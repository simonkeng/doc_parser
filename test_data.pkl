Coelum Terrae by Thomas Vaughan\u000aConclusion\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aBOOK ONE\u000aCHAPTER ONE\u000aINTRODUCTION\u000aThe word Alchemy is an Arabic term consisting of the article al and the noun khemi. We may take\u000ait that the noun refers to Egypt, whose Coptic name is Khem. The word, then, would yield the phrase\u000a\u201cthe Egyptian matter\u201d, or \u201cthat which appertains to Egypt\u201d. The hypothesis is that the Mohammedan\u000agrammarians held that the alchemical art was derived from that wisdom of the Egyptians which was the\u000aproud boast of Moses, Plato, and Pythagoras, and the source, therefore, of their illuminations. If,\u000ahowever, we assume the word to be of Greek origin, as do some authorities, then it implies nothing\u000amore than the chemical art, the method of mingling and making infusions. Originally all that chemistry\u000ameant was the art of extracting juices from plants and herbs.\u000aModern scholarship still leaves unsolved the question as to whether alchemical treatises should be\u000aclassified as mystical, magical, or simply primitively chemical. The most reasonable view is, in my\u000aopinion, not to place them exclusively in any one category, but to assume that all these objects at one\u000atime formed in varying proportions the preoccupation of different alchemists. Or, better still, that\u000adifferent alchemists became attracted to different interpretations or levels of the art. There is no doubt\u000athat by some writers alchemy was interpreted in a categorical and literal sense - that is, as a chemical\u000ameans whereby the baser metals could be transformed and made precious. There is a vast body of\u000atestimony to this end, evidence which cannot be made to yield any interpretation other than a physical\u000aand chemical one. On the other hand, there are certain alchemistical philosophers to whom it would be\u000aimpossible to impute any other interest than a mystical or religious one.\u000aAlchemy is also called Hermeticism. Hermes, from the mythological standpoint, is the Egyptian\u000agod both of Wisdom and Magic - which concepts include therapeutics and physical science as then it\u000awas known. All these subjects may, therefore, claim just inclusion within the scope of the significance\u000aof the terms Alchemy and Hermetic subjects.\u000aIt cannot be doubted in any way that such writers as Robert Fludd, Henry Khunrath, and Jacob\u000aBoehme aspired to and wrote of spiritual perfection, a state or mystical condition which was\u000arepresented to them by the Stone of the Philosophers. With this idea I shall deal at some length in\u000asucceeding pages. It is equally certain that the first consideration of Paracelsus, for example, was the\u000acure of disease and the prolongation of life. At the same time his greatest achievements appear to most\u000amodern thinkers to have been his discoveries of opium, zinc, and hydrogen. We tend, therefore, to think\u000aof him as a chemist no less than we do Van Helmont, whose conception of gas ranks him as one of\u000athose rare geniuses who have increased human knowledge by a fundamentally important idea.\u000aBut another viewpoint is possible here. For alongside of the genuine researchers, the alchemists\u000awho employed a psychological or spiritual technique, or who were genuine chemists or healers, we have\u000athe scrambling throng of the uninitiated. These had utterly failed to penetrate the secret of the true\u000adoctrine on any of its several levels, and commenced working on anomalous materials which could\u000anever bring them to the desired end. These were the false alchemists derisively named the Puffers. It is\u000anot, then, from alchemy proper or legitimate alchemists, as is so often assumed, that modern chemistry\u000aderives, but actually from the erratic work of the Puffers. These spent themselves in experiments on\u000aalien substances and animal excreta condemned by the true adepts. In consequence, they never achieved\u000athe desired result - the Philosopher\u2019s Stone. But on the other hand, they were led by chance into\u000aunexpected and, for us, most useful discoveries. As an instance we may cite Künckel who isolated\u000aphosphorus, which he most certainly was not anticipating. Or Blaise de Vignère who discovered\u000abenzoic acid without being aware of it. We may also cite the salts isolated by and named after Glauber.\u000aHistorically, the literature is immense. Represented in India and the Near East, in the Greek,\u000aRoman, Byzantine, and the Arabic civilizations as well as in Hebrew writings, the entire literature runs\u000ato thousands of titles. In recent years, moreover, we have had the publication of an important Chinese\u000atext. Most treatises from the Aesch Metzareph of the Qabalists to Valentine\u2019s The Chariot of Antimony,\u000aare deliberately couched in hieratic riddles. Persecution by church, and the profanation of the secrets of\u000apower, whether real or imagined, were equally dreaded by the adepts of the art. Worse still, from the\u000amodern viewpoint, these motives and these literary techniques induced their authors to insert\u000aintentionally misleading statements, the more deeply to bewilder unworthy pretenders to their mysteries.\u000aOthers, ignorant of the first principles of the art, the unscrupulous charlatans whom we have seen were\u000a\u000aPage 2\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000acalled Puffers, and many another quack, taking advantage of the general credulity and superstition\u000aprevailing at these times, issued utterly meaningless and nonsensical works pretending to reveal the\u000aworking of the alchemical art.\u000aWith these latter I am obviously not concerned in this place. Nor, for the moment, am I interested\u000ain the purely chemical aspect of the subject, however valid such an interpretation may be. My principal\u000aconcern at the moment, when Analytical Psychology and psychological methods daily prove more\u000aabsorbing, is to divine whether or not there is anything concealed within these obscurities which related\u000ato man, revealing methods of perfecting or integrating his consciousness. I believe that they do, and\u000atherefore I propose an examination of a text or two to see in what way our present views may not be\u000aenlarged.\u000aA cursory glance at certain sections of the alchemical literature reveals the fact that the art relates\u000ato what anciently was known as Theurgy - the divine work. Its object was to afford by technical\u000amethods of meditation, reflection, magical practices and forms of interior prayer, a more rapid mode of\u000aspiritual development and an acceleration of intellectual evolution.\u000aThe alchemical and magical theories roughly amount to this: In the course of long aeons of time,\u000aNature has gradually evolved a complex mechanism of reaction which we call Man. Marvellous as this\u000aorganism is in many ways, yet it manifests several defects. A stream cannot rise higher than its source.\u000aAnd without entering into the complicated and at first sight rather bewildering realm of alchemical\u000acosmological theories, it is held that Nature has fallen from a certain divine state - from grace as it were.\u000aIt may be said that man\u2019s consciousness has relegated to a sub-ordinate place the once proud and divine\u000auniversal spirit. An efficient and useful servant, it has usurped the place of its lord and master.\u000aBecause of this condition of things, it is held that by herself and unassisted Nature cannot regain\u000aher former glorified condition of equilibrium. The alchemists referred to all things within the natural\u000arealm - especially the unawakened and unenlightened man, torn perpetually by internal conflict. For\u000aman to attain something other than an intolerable state of conflict with the misery and suffering and\u000auncertainty resulting therefrom, some other and higher means than are found in the natural state are\u000arequired to transcend his constant companions of fear, inferiority, and insecurity. The alchemists assert\u000athat everything within the circle of limited and fallen Nature can only beget its kind. Hence man\u2019s own\u000anatural efforts in an intellectual direction cannot elevate him beyond his natural state and can only beget\u000aa similar kind of unregenerate, unillumined condition. Thus the continual failure of philosophy, politics\u000aand sectarian religion.\u000aBut there is the aphorism \u201cArt perfects what Nature began\u201d. And, as another Alchemist has\u000aaffirmed, \u201cOur gold is produced by art, adding nothing, detracting nothing, but only eliminating\u000asuperfluities.\u201d In other words, the alchemical assertion is that in man is latent an element of Wisdom\u000awhich, so long as the natural state of conflict and ignorance exists, remains dormant and in obscuration.\u000a\u201cWithin the material extreme of life, when it is purified, the Seed of the Spirit is at last found.\u201d The\u000aentire object of art is the uncovering of the inner faculty of insight and wisdom, the \u201cessence of mind\u000awhich is intrinsically pure\u201d, and the removal of the veils intervening between the mind and diverting it\u000afrom its hidden divine root.\u000aExistence and the ordinary turmoil of life, the struggle and the confusion which sooner or later\u000abinds consciousness by manifold links to an unevolved infantile and emotional attitude towards life,\u000acreate anxiety and deep-seated fears. We entertain fear for the morrow and in the face of the\u000aunexpected. Fear and anxiety give rise in early life to automatisms and compulsive behaviour, to what\u000amight be called a shrinkage of the sphere of consciousness. It sets up an involuntary habitual\u000acontraction of the ego instead of a full-hearted easy acceptance of whatever may come in life, be it joy\u000aor sorrow, pain or pleasure. Continued sufficiently long, this attitude develops into mental rigidity, into\u000aa closed and crystallized conscious outlook, complacent and narrow, in which all further growth is\u000aimpossible. Apart, from this, many people become fixed and hidebound for quite other reasons becoming over-attached to traditional and unoriginal modes of thinking and feeling. The result is that\u000aall spontaneity of intellect and feeling is thoroughly eliminated from the realm of possibility. It is a\u000asacrifice which entails the death of all that is creative within. The individual becomes enclosed within\u000aan iron cage of his own construction - forged through fear of life. From this, there seems no escape. No\u000adoubt consciousness becomes developed to a very high degree, to the point where it becomes clear,\u000ainventive, and trenchant. It becomes so, however, at the expense of life itself. Such a development is at\u000athe expense of flexibility and elasticity. Its cost is the loss of all that the underlying and dynamic\u000aunconscious aspect of the psyche implies - warmth, depth of feeling, inspiration, and ease of life and\u000aliving. Too great a price to be paid.\u000aNow, it is with this rigidity of consciousness, with this inflexible crystallized condition of mind,\u000athat Alchemy, like modern Psychotherapy, proposes to deal, and, moreover, to eradicate. Psychotherapy\u000a\u000aPage 3\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aaccording to one popular writer, is a means of obtaining self-knowledge through breaking down the\u000ashell of fantasy in which the ordinary person is confined. Analysis is sometimes defined as a process the\u000aobject of which is to enhance consciousness. It proceeds by making conscious those unconscious\u000aelements in the instinctual and morally compulsive life which experience demonstrates to be in conflict\u000awith or untrue to reality. The crystallization of the field of consciousness, with its consequent narrowing\u000aof the possibilities of experience, produces a species of living death. The alchemists proposed to kill\u000adeath. Their object, by the psychological method of interpretation, was to disintegrate this inflexible\u000arigidity of mind. This process they call the dissolution or putrefaction. Consciousness is broken down\u000ainto its component parts. From this apparently amorphous and homogenous resultant, it was their\u000aintention to reassemble the fundamental elements of consciousness on an entirely new and healthy basis.\u000aIt was proposed to establish another foundation altogether, one capable of functioning in a completely\u000aregal and spiritual way. So that the divine root which, according to their theory, had become occultated\u000aand subordinated by the presumption of man\u2019s ego, is able to manifest through a mentality which is free\u000afrom the defects which characterize the average intelligence. Consciousness is to be vivified utterly and\u000ais not separated from the Unconscious by a sharp and unnatural cleavage or partition from the other\u000alevels of the psyche. Thus the contents of the one part, by a reversal of values and functions, have full\u000aaccess of entry into the other, and vice versa.\u000aLike modern psychological methods the alchemical formulae have as their goal the creation of a\u000awhole man, of integrity. What the psychotherapist proposes is freedom from the nervous and defensive\u000aautomatisms that render men slaves of impulse and emotion, the automatism of the drunkard, for\u000aexample, the drug addict, the kleptomaniac, the chronic waverer, the choleric, the coward. I make but\u000alittle mention of the normal habits and automatisms of the so-called average man, though the neurotic\u000aexpressions are but slight exaggerations of them. One of the reasons why psychotherapy is so difficult\u000afor the layman to grasp is that few people are aware of the preponderance of such automatic reactions in\u000aall ordinary human conduct.\u000aNot only does Alchemy envisage an individual whose several constituents of consciousness are\u000aunited, but with the characteristic thoroughness of all occult or magical methods it proceeds a stage\u000afurther. It aspires towards the development of an integrated and free man who is illumined. It is here\u000athat Alchemy parts company with orthodox Psychology. Its technique envisages a religious or spiritual\u000agoal. In much the same terms as Eastern philosophy, Alchemy propounds the question, \u201cWhat is it, by\u000aknowing which, we have all knowledge?\u201d This is the theme, allowing for variations of a minor\u000acharacter, pervading the entire nature of Brahmanism and Buddhism, as well as the whole of archaic\u000aphilosophy and religion. The Tractatus Aureus avers that \u201cAll the wisdoms of the world, O Son, are\u000acomprehended in this my hidden Wisdom.\u201d It is this which gives Alchemy that peculiar attraction which\u000aalways in the West it has enjoyed, regardless of whether or not its terms have been completely\u000aunderstood in the clear light of logical thought.\u000aIn order the better to comprehend the basic postulates of this aspect of Alchemy which are\u000aconcealed in a seemingly barbarous and unintelligible terminology, I propose to provide a brief\u000acomparison of its terms with those of other systems. Here we will employ a form of the Tree of Life as\u000aunderstood by the Jewish Qabalists as the fundamental basis of comparison. Its capacity to refer all\u000asymbologies to a single source of reference, thus rendering them more or less intelligible by a process\u000aof classification, is the indubitable virtue of this scheme. Where it is possible I shall refer to Analytical\u000aPsychology for a more modern and readily understandable explanation. Book One will be commented\u000aupon precisely in that light. The Six Keys of Eudoxus, the second text, will be interpreted in terms of\u000acertain aspects of Magic and Animal Magnetism or Mesmerism. These two attempts at interpretation\u000awill render the third text by Vaughan more or less clear.\u000aSince a comparatively complete exposition of the Qabalah may be found in other of my writing, it\u000awould be needlessly repetitive to go over the same ground. This diagram shows the Ten Sephiros of the\u000aTree of Life arranged in such a way that the seven planets of the astrological scheme may be referred to\u000athem. In addition, there is another unnumbered sphere named Dads, Knowledge. The Philosophy\u000asupposes this to be an entirely new principle latent within consciousness, developing or externalizing\u000aitself as and when man acquires complete and full self-consciousness. With this principle I shall not\u000adeal for the moment, though its mention was important, since it refers to an end result. It is a final goal\u000aof the system, the purified and integrated consciousness developed after the various experimental stages\u000aof the Alchemical work have been completed. The other principles, or Sephiros as they are called, I\u000ahave numbered for convenience\u2019 sake. These I can now describe in terms of the usual alchemical,\u000apsychological, and other occult clichés and ideas.\u000aFor our purposes, those principles numbered 4 to 7 inclusive are more important, entering more\u000afrequently than the others into exegesis. The trinity of potencies comprising the first circle refer to that\u000a\u000aPage 4\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000adivine root of man\u2019s being which is the deepest core of the Unconscious, the \u201cIt\u201d, the \u201cessence of mind\u000awhich is intrinsically pure\u201d. It is the realization in consciousness of this root, pure potentiality, and its\u000aassimilation into the everyday thinking of man, which is the final goal of all spiritual techniques.\u000aVarious faculties of consciousness, memory, will, etc., are comprised in the second and third spheres.\u000aThe principle numbered 4 is the Ruach, the mind, the reasoning faculties. It is referred to the\u000aelement Air. I am here reminded of the archaic and primitive correspondences - geist, pneuma, ruach,\u000abreath, spirit, etc. It is consciousness itself, operating as the ruler of the body. It is also named Tipharas,\u000ameaning beauty and harmony and equilibrium, its symbol being the interlaced triangles. The latter\u000aindicates the union and therefore the reconciliation of two opposing elements in a single symbol. Fire is\u000athe upright triangle, and Water - the downpointing triangle. This intrinsic tendency towards\u000areconciliation is considered implicit within the nature of consciousness. That is to say, it indicates\u000aintellectual acumen and insight into the nature of the pairs of opposites. This faculty of understanding\u000aenables it to arrive at a third and reconciling factor of poise and rhythm. Another correspondence often\u000aemployed is the Sun. Since the latter is the vital centre of the solar system radiating life and heat to all\u000aabout it, and without which life could not be - so at the centre of man is this rational intellectual faculty\u000awithout which man is no longer man.\u000a\u000a1\u000a3\u000a\u000a2\u000a4\u000a\u000a6\u000a\u000a5\u000a7\u000a\u000aFig.1 - The Tree of Life\u000aInasmuch as it is the development of this particular type of consciousness which is assumed to\u000adifferentiate man from and above all other creatures, elevating him above every other department of\u000anature, it is quite often referred to as Gold, the most perfect and precious of metals. In the Alchemical\u000atexts the intellect is also one of the Three Principles, the purified Mercury defined as \u201cphilosophic,\u000afiery, vital, running, which may be mixed with all other metals and again separated from them. It is\u000aprepared in the innermost chamber of life and there it is coagulated\u201d. And again, when referred to as the\u000aPhilosopher\u2019s Stone, we have this definition from The Golden Treatise of Hermes: \u201cIn the cavern of the\u000ametals, there is hidden the Stone that is venerable, splendid in colour, a mind sublime and an open sea.\u201d\u000aBut this latter refers more accurately to the consciousness itself represented as a scintillating gem of\u000auntold price and brilliance, the redeeming, saving stone. It becomes this only after the several\u000aalchemical operations when it has been dissolved, coagulated, calcined, purified, refined, and\u000asublimated into the newly arisen king\u2019s son, crowned with the Spirit, cloaked with the royal purple, and\u000aexalted into the treasure of the world.\u000aThe fifth principle on our chart is the emotional, feeling, and passional urge, which gives motive\u000aand direction to life. In contrast to most Western thinking, occultism sharply separates emotion as a\u000aprinciple from mental activity - though it is admitted that in actual practice the activities of the two do\u000aoverlap each other considerably. The nature of this principle is fiery, as witness various colloquialisms\u000aand figures of speech: \u201cthy fire of thy love\u201d, \u201cthe white heat of passion\u201d, \u201cconsuming flames of\u000apassion\u201d, and \u201cardent desires\u201d. Alchemistically, this identifies emotion and feeling with the principle\u000aSulphur, a fiery dynamic principle, on the correct employment and application of which the entire work\u000adepends. The regimen of the fire is the crucial and critical operation of Alchemy - even as in a lesser\u000away it is in Psychotherapy. In certain psychological cases the awakening of a dormant or repressed side\u000aof the patient\u2019s nature, and the union of consciousness with the anima or fiery emotional nature,\u000aproduces integrity and wholeness and a higher synthesis of being.\u000aThe sixth principle implies form. Properly, it is the vehicular side of consciousness. Its nature is\u000asubstantive. One characteristic of occult philosophy is the theorem that every state of consciousness has\u000aits own particular type of matter. We have the idea in all magical philosophy of a so-called mental body\u000aor sheath, of a mind clothed with a fluidic body of thought, grounded in a substance of extreme tenuity\u000aand subtlety. Referred to the planet Mercury (not to the alchemical principle also of that name) which\u000a\u000aPage 5\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aimplies intelligence and consciousness of a kind, its elemental attribution is Water. This latter brings out\u000athe correspondence of a fluidic plastic substance forming the etheric or astral body of the mind. The\u000aappropriate alchemical principle is Salt, the last of the triad, conceived of as an inert, heavy mineral\u000abody. Just as the alchemical Mercury refers to Consciousness, and Sulphur to emotion and feeling, so\u000athis principle of Salt refers more particularly to the sheath or vehicle in which these faculties are\u000agrounded.\u000aAfter the above was written the writer glanced through Geraldine Coster\u2019s Yoga and Western\u000aPsychology, where the following passage occurs: \u201cThe European can readily enough grasp the idea that\u000athe physical universe is a manifestation of spirit and mater in innumerable and indissoluble\u000acombinations, because he is aware of that mysterious something called \u2018life\u2019 which permeates all things,\u000abut it is to him a staggering improbability that the interior processes of emotion, thought, and will\u000apossess at their own level suitable forms, forms which are substantial to the perception of those levels of\u000aexperience \u2026. All experiences consist of spirit-matter of varying degrees of density and the response of\u000aconsciousness to this stimulus. Thus feelings and thoughts exist in space, have a shape, a rate of\u000amovement, and a period of duration.\u201d\u000aNot only is this peculiar to all Hindu philosophy and psychology, but it underlies Hermeticism as\u000awell. To recapitulate, we have a mental body which comprises or is the seat of all the mental faculties intelligence, emotion, will, memory, etc., together with a certain degree of plastic, fluidic, and vital\u000asubstance. The whole, when it is purified and integrated, and not otherwise, forms what the Alchemists\u000aname the Philosopher\u2019s Stone.\u000aA dual concept is contained in the seventh principle. The first half is in itself a synthetic idea.\u000aPrimarily it is a concept including the three Alchemical Principles of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury,\u000aconsidered as an undivided whole. It is a unit, however, only prior to the purification of art, one object\u000aof which is to differentiate them from their homogenous base. Then, when their ideas have been\u000aassimilated to consciousness, they may sink back again into the unconscious. This principle, in its\u000anatural state, is of little value to the operator, yet without its knowledge he cannot proceed. Purified and\u000arectified, however, it is the Stone itself, though it is then called by some other name. But within it, as\u000asaid before, are the three dormant principles, for which reason it is often called Mercury alone, the other\u000aprinciples being considered latent and implicit. Its other names are the Quintessence, Azoth, our Water,\u000aor the Astral Ether. It quintessentializes the four elements of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire. It is axiomatic\u000athat any single principle or unit is multiple when observed from a higher level - that is, with additional\u000ainsight. A multiplicity is a unity when approached or seen from below. For example, a table is merely a\u000asimple wooden piece of furniture to the average person. To a more thinking type, its substance is seen\u000ato be comprised of innumerable molecules and atoms in varying proportions, vibrating at enormous\u000aspeed so as to give the sensory impression of solidity and hardness. Another individual of greater\u000ainsight will perceive that what his fellow saw as a table or as a congeries of atoms, is in reality spiritual\u000aenergy polarizing itself into positive and negative charges forming electrons, neutrons, and protons,\u000awhich circulate and move at a tremendous vibratory rate. On its own plane, therefore, the Quintessence\u000ais a unity synthesizing the four elements of a lower plane. Looked at from above it is no longer simple\u000aand homogenous but a compound of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury - of abstract philosophical principles.\u000aThe Eastern equivalent of the Quintessence is Prana or the life-force sustaining and permeating the\u000abody. Since the Qabalistic and magical attribution is Air, we have the idea of the atmosphere or oxygen\u000aconcealing or being the vehicle of a dynamizing vital principle. Here is the rationale of certain types of\u000aYoga breathing exercises. The breath is the vehicle of prana, life, vitality, animal magnetism, which as\u000anervous energy transmits the commands of the Mind to the body in much the same way as the\u000aatmosphere reflects or transmits the heat of the Sun. So that by various kinds of breath regulation, the\u000apractitioner of these special modes of breathing anticipates the increase of his vitality. As a corollary to\u000athis, such an increase is said to improve and extend the horizon of his mind so that it comes to embrace\u000aand recognize the spiritual principle pervading all life and living things.\u000aSalt, Sulphur, and Mercury are concepts synthesized by the term Quintessence, the First Matter.\u000aThis is that which first of all must be sought out and discovered. Since the water of the Wise, the\u000aResidual or Magical Earth, is not physical in the ordinary sense of the word, it has been most curiously\u000adefined and concealed. Basil Valentine, defining the nature of this First Matter, declares it to be\u000acomparable to no manifested particular whatever, and that all description fails in respect of it without\u000athe light of true experience. Sendivogius proffers that \u201cour Water is heavenly, not wetting the hands, not\u000aof the vulgar, but almost rain water\u201d. It is heavenly, so to say, only because, like rain, it descends from\u000athe heavens above. Vaughan defines it as \u201ca world without form, a divine animated mass of complexion\u000alike silver, neither mere power nor perfect action, but a weak virgin substance, a certain prolific Venus,\u000athe very love and seed of Nature, the mixture and moisture of heaven and earth\u201d.\u000a\u000aPage 6\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aAlbertus Magnus states that Mercury is \u201ca watery element, cold and moist, a permanent body, an\u000aunctuous vapour, and the spirit of the body\u201d. \u201cO how wonderful is that Thing which has in itself all\u000athings which we seek, to which we add nothing different or extract, only in the preparation removing\u000asuperfluities\u201d in yet another panegyric to the virtues of this First Matter of the Wise.\u000aThe above will show how ambiguous these definitions are without some fairly illuminating system\u000awhich may give a clarified vision of their import. It remains to be added that one\u2019s first clairvoyant view\u000aof astral matter seems to be of a white or silvery cloud, smoke, or vapour, in a state of great activity and\u000amovement. The pictures that project themselves upon it slowly unwind themselves before the mental or\u000ainner vision like a cinematograph film.\u000aAs a general concept we may more or less identify this Water of the Wise with the magician\u2019s\u000aAstral Light and this again with the Collective Unconscious of modern psychology. It is defined by\u000aJung in his commentary to The Secret of the Golden Flower as a psychic substrate common to all men\u000aalike. \u201cIt transcends all differences of culture and consciousness and does not consist merely of contents\u000acapable of becoming conscious but of latent dispositions towards identical reactions.\u201d And elsewhere he\u000awrites that \u201cthe Collective Unconscious, moreover, seems \u2026 something like an unceasing stream or\u000aperhaps an ocean of images, figures which drift into consciousness in our dreams or in abnormal states\u000aof mind\u201d.\u000aWe may now glance at the remaining dual concept of the seventh principle, also considered under\u000aseveral aspects. First of all, since the other principles have elemental correspondences, so Malkus, as\u000athis principle is named, is referred to the element Earth, implying solidity, firmness, and an unchanging\u000areceptacle or base in which manifest the other principles. On the other hand it is often depicted as being\u000athe sphere of the operation of the four elements of earth, air, fire, and water, whilst the other spheres are\u000agiven planetary attributions.\u000aMoreover, it may be considered as the instinctive life, the body consciousness, or the brain-mind. It\u000acorresponds with the mythological Persephone, the animal or unredeemed soul which is in exile from\u000athe promised land, lost, wandering in the wild darkness, ever in search of some abiding city. The\u000aphysical body itself would seem not to be shown on this chart system, except by reference to an\u000aassumed and hypothetical subterranean world of shells. This theory implies that the physical body as\u000asuch is an illusion. Not, let me hasten to add, in the false sense that it has no real existence, as some\u000apeople seemed disposed to misinterpret the word. But rather, that it is not what it appears to be. The\u000amore or less permanent human form is a subtle etheric invisible body, an ideal shape or design. About\u000aand through it physical atoms, in a state of great activity and vibration, congregate and play, being\u000aattracted and repelled continuously to form by such a circulation an illusory appearance.\u000aAfter a perusal of Jung\u2019s comments in The Secret of the Golden Flower it is difficult to gather\u000awhether, although corroborating the idea of psychic changes induced by the technique described in that\u000abook, he rejects the validity of the breath- or subtle-body hypothesis.* If this is the case, then\u000adeliberately he ignores a vast body of material which is as evidential and as strictly scientific as any\u000abody of material evidence could be. It is important to mention this inasmuch as it touched upon what\u000athe Alchemists called their First Matter.\u000aFirst of all, there are the researches and investigations in the last century of Baron von\u000aReichenbach. He worked with a number of sensitives both under hypnosis and in normal consciousness.\u000aThe result of his investigations was such as to prove beyond doubt that about each living human being or for that matter, around every object in living nature - was a glow of living light, a dynamic\u000aemanation. This he called the \u201codic glow\u201d. Nowadays the term for it is the aura, which is considered to\u000abe the vital emanation from this interior design- or thought-body. The hypnotic pioneer James Braid\u000atook Reichenbach to task, attempting to demonstrate that all of the observations which emanated from\u000athe Baron\u2019s sensitives were due entirely and exclusively to suggestion. Braid\u2019s attitude is really\u000acharacteristic of the whole of the extreme and one-sided scientific approach of the last century.\u000aFortunately it is now outworn, and we are coming to adopt that point of view which accepts facts rather\u000athan attempts to force facts into a predetermined theory. The fact that Braid duplicated all\u000aReichenbach\u2019s results by deliberately rejecting or suggesting them to his hypnotized subjects is by no\u000ameans a valid mode of criticism. One might as well argue that since Messrs. Maskelyne and Devant\u000awith their intricate apparatus and conjuring knowledge can duplicate certain of the psychic phenomena\u000aof the psychical research societies, therefore the phenomena there observed and recorded are disproved\u000a*\u000a\u000aThis was written in December 1936. The issue since that time appears to have been considerably\u000aclearer. At this moment (March 1938) I have before me Jung\u2019s new book of Terry Lectures Psychology\u000aand Religion, where the following statement is made: \u201cI have often felt tempted to advise my patients to\u000aconceive of the psyche as of a subtle body \u2026\u201d\u000a\u000aPage 7\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aand invalid. Reichenbach approached his investigations with more or less an open mind. So far from\u000asuggesting ideas to his subjects and sensitives, the fact remains that quite by accident they stumbled\u000aacross the various phenomena of \u201codism\u201d which he spent the rest of his life in investigating.\u000aReichenbach\u2019s results have within the past couple of decades obtained definite verification from a\u000atotally unexpected source. This time, from an individual whose orthodox standing and integrity can\u000ahardly be questioned, and who cannot be suspected of psychic or spiritualistic sympathies. I refer to Dr.\u000aKilner of St. Thomas\u2019s Hospital. He wrote a few years ago a book entitled The Human Atmosphere,\u000adescribing his experimental work on auras. It seems that he had invented some screens which he stained\u000awith dicyanin, through which he examined the atmosphere surrounding innumerable patients of his\u000ahospital. At first sight it could be argued that what he perceived had no necessary connection with\u000aobjective reality, being simply an optical resultant of the employment of chemical substances and stains.\u000aOn the other hand, it had an empirical value. By this means he was able to diagnose disease, to view the\u000ashape and size of the aura, and to describe the state and condition of the auras of different people in\u000avarying states of health and sickness.\u000aQuite apart from this, however, there is a third source of evidence. I refer to the research done by\u000aRichet, Schrenck Notzing, Geley, Crawford, and a host of others in connection with the séance-room\u000aphenomena, quite apart from spiritualistic theories, and this I believe convincing and evidential. It was\u000afound that objects could be moved experimentally at a distance, under rigorous test conditions, without\u000aphysical contact. Materialized shapes of various kinds would manifest in the research chamber,\u000aapparently exuded unconsciously from the body of the medium. The substance of these shapes received\u000aa specially coined word, ectoplasm. There is no doubt in my mind, from a critical examination of\u000aavailable material, that this ectoplasm corresponds to an objectified from of the plastic substance\u000acomprising the interior subtle or astral body, and which the Alchemists named their First Matter. W.J.\u000aCrawford, after a host of experimental work with a medium, showed that her weight and the volume of\u000aher thighs diminished when ectoplasm was projected in the form of a materialization. In many instances\u000ahe was able not only to view such shapes, but to feel them and observe empirically their structure. His\u000adescription of this substance is that it is cold, heavy, damp, or, according to varying circumstances, as\u000ahard and rigid as metal.\u000aGeley also described this substance. He notes that it is variable in appearance, being sometimes\u000avaporous, sometimes a plastic paste, sometimes a bundle of fine threads, or a membrane with swellings\u000aor fringes, etc. It may be white, grey, or black in colour, quite often it is seen to be luminous, as if\u000aphosphorescent. Its visibility may wax or wane, and to the touch it may feel soft, elastic, fibrous, or\u000ahard. It has the power of self-locomotion, and moves generally as with a slow reptilian movement,\u000athough that is not to say that it is incapable of moving with extreme rapidity. It may be said to have an\u000ainherent tendency to organization, but it is of no mechanical kind. Its propensity is to take any form or\u000ashape which may be dictated or imagined unconsciously by the medium.\u000aThis is a brief description, condensed from innumerable experiments, of the substance which\u000aexudes from the body of the medium when in a trance state, and which builds itself up into bodies,\u000aheads, amorphous shapes, rods, and levers. It is this substance also which moves objects from a distance\u000aand achieves the phenomena of telekinesis, and may also become sufficiently solid to intercept an infrared beam of light.\u000aI have detailed these facts as proof, quite apart from other directly experiential data of the\u000aalchemical theory, that there is such an astral or design body within the physical frame. The ancient\u000aview was that it is the medium or intermediate state between mind and body, thus establishing a\u000acontinuum. And that, moreover, it is the direct vehicle of the mental and emotional faculties in the\u000afullest sense of these terms. Finally, it is this interior psychic form which is the subject of the alchemical\u000aexperiment. And it is this which, because of its appearance to clairvoyant or spiritual vision, is called\u000aThe Philosopher\u2019s Stone when remoulded and perfected. In the words of Khunrath: \u201cOur King and Lord\u000aof Hosts goes forth from the chamber of his glassy sepulchre into this mundane sphere in his glorified\u000abody, regenerate and in perfection perfected, as a shining carbuncle, most temperate in splendour, and\u000awhose parts, most subtle and most pure, are inseparably blent together in the harmonious rest of union\u000ainto one.\u201d\u000a\u000aPage 8\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aCHAPTER TWO\u000aThe Golden Treatise1 of Hermes Trismegistus,\u000aconcerning the Physical secret of the Philosopher\u2019s Stone.\u000aIn Seven Sections\u000aSECTION FIRST\u000a1. Even thus saith Hermes: Through long years, I have not ceased to experiment, neither have I\u000aspared any labour of mind; and this science and art I have obtained by the inspiration of the living God\u000aalone, who judged fit to open them to me His servant. To those enabled by reason to judge of truth He\u000ahas given power to arbitrate, but to none occasion of delinquency.\u000a2. For myself, I had never discovered this matter to any one, had it not been from fear of the day\u000aof judgment, and the perdition of my soul, if I concealed it. It is a debt which I am desirous to discharge\u000ato the faithful, as the Author of our faith did deign to bestow it upon me.\u000a3. Understand ye then, O sons of Wisdom, that the knowledge of the four elements of the ancient\u000aphilosophers was not corporally or imprudently sought after, which are through patience to be\u000adiscovered according to their causes and their occult operation. For their operation is occult, since\u000anothing is done except it be compounded, and because it is not perfected unless the colours be\u000athoroughly passed and accomplished.\u000a4. Know then, that the division that was made upon the Water, by the ancient philosophers,\u000aseparates it into four substances, one to two, and three to one, the one third part of which is colour, that\u000ais to say -a coagulating moisture; but the two third waters are the Weights of the Wise.\u000a5. Take of the humidity an ounce and a half, and of the Meridian Redness, that is the soul of gold,\u000aa fourth part, that is to say, half an ounce of the citrine Seyre, in like manner, half an ounce; of the\u000aAuripigment, half - which are eight - that is three ounces; and know ye that the vine of the wise is drawn\u000aforth in three, and the wine thereof is perfected in thirty.\u000a6. Understand the operation, therefore, decoction lessens the matter, but the tincture augments it;\u000abecause Luna after fifteen days is diminished; and in the third, she is augmented. This is the beginning\u000aand the end.\u000a7. Behold, I have declared that which had been concealed, since the work is both with you and\u000aabout you; taking what is within and fixed, thou canst have it either in earth or sea.\u000a8. Keep therefore, thy Argent vive, which is prepared in the innermost chamber in which it is\u000acoagulated; for that is Mercury which is spoken of concerning the residual earth.\u000a9. He therefore, who now hears my words, let him search into them; I have discovered all things\u000athat were before hidden concerning this knowledge, and disclosed the greatest of all secrets.\u000a10. Know ye, therefore, Enquirers into the rumour, and Children of Wisdom, that the vulture\u000astanding upon the mountain crieth out with a loud voice, I am the White of the Black, and the Red of\u000athe White and the Citrine of the Red; and I speak the very truth.\u000a11. And know that the chief principle of the art is the Crow, which in the blackness of the night\u000aand clearness of the day, flies without wings. From the bitterness existing in the throat, the tincture is\u000ataken, the red goes forth from his body, and from his back is taken a pure water.\u000a12. Understand, therefore, and accept this gift of God. In the caverns of the metals there is hidden\u000athe Stone that is venerable, splendid in colour, a mind sublime, and an open sea. Behold I have declared\u000ait unto thee; give thanks to God, who hath taught you this knowledge; for He loves the grateful.\u000a13. Put the matter into a moist fire, therefore, and cause it to boil, in order that its heat may be\u000aaugmented, which destroys the siccity of the incombustible nature, until the radix may appear; then\u000aextract the redness and the light part, till the third part remains.\u000a\u000a1 The Golden Treatise, says Arthur Edward Waite in his work The Secret Tradition in Alchemy, first\u000aappeared at Leipzig in 1600 under the editorship of Dr. Guecias, and again in 1610. An English version\u000awas included by William Salmon in his Medicina Practica. Waite asserts that there is not only no Greek\u000aoriginal but as a Latin text it is a late production. He also says Mrs. Atwood\u2019s version which is our text\u000adiffers from Salmon\u2019s\u000a(Note: - The numbering of the verses does not exist in the former texts. This is simply my own\u000ainclusion, adopted for convenience\u2019 sake. - I.R.)\u000a\u000aPage 9\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000a14. Sons of the Sages! For this reason are philosophers said to be envious; not that they grudge the\u000atruth to religious or just men, or to the wise; but to the ignorant and vicious, who are without selfcontrol and benevolence, lest they should be made powerful in evil for the perpetration of sinful things;\u000aand in consequence philosophers are made accountable to God. Evil men are unworthy of wisdom.\u000a15. Know that this matter I call the Stone; but it is also named the feminine of magnesia, or the\u000ahen, or the white spittle, or the volatile milk, the incombustible ash, in order that it may be hidden from\u000athe inept and ignorant, who are deficient in goodness and self-control; which I have nevertheless\u000asignified to the wise by one only epithet, viz. the Philosopher\u2019s Stone. Include, therefore, and conserve\u000ain that sea, the fire, and the heavenly Flyer, to the latest moment of his exit. But I adjure you all, Sons of\u000aphilosophy, by our Benefactor who gives to you the ornament of His grace, that to no fatuous, ignorant,\u000aor inept person ye open this Stone.\u000a16. I have received nothing from any, to whom I have not returned that which he had given me,\u000anor have I failed to honour and highly respect Him.\u000a17. This, O son, is the concealed Stone of many colours; which is born in one colour; know this\u000aand conceal it. By this, the Almighty favouring, the greatest diseases are escaped, and every sorrow,\u000adistress, and evil and hurtful thing is made to depart. It leads from darkness into light, from this desert\u000awilderness to a secure habitation, and from poverty and straights, to a free and ample fortune.\u000aSECOND SECTION\u000a1. My son, before all things I admonish thee to fear God, in whom is the strength of thy\u000aundertaking; and the bond of each separated element. My son, whatsoever thou hearest, consider it\u000arationally. For I hold thee not to be a fool. Lay hold, therefore, of my instructions and meditate upon\u000athem, and so let thy heart be fitted, as if thou wast thyself the author of that which I now teach. If thou\u000aappliest cold to any nature that is hot, it will hurt it: in like manner, he who is rational shuts himself\u000awithin from the threshold of ignorance; lest supinely he should be deceived.\u000a2. Take the flying volatile and drown it flying, and divide and separate it from its rust, which yet\u000aholds it in death; draw it forth, and repel it from itself, that it may live and answer thee, not by flying\u000aaway into the regions above, but by truly forbearing to fly. For if thou shalt deliver it out of its\u000astraitness, after this imprisonment, and in the days known to thee shalt by reason have ruled it, then will\u000ait become a suitable companion unto thee, and by it thou wilt become to be a conquering lord, with it\u000aadorned.\u000a3. Extract from the ray its shadow and impurity by which the clouds hang over it, defile and keep\u000aaway the light; since by means of its constriction and fiery redness, it is burned. Take, my son, this\u000aredness, corrupted with the water, which is as a live coal holding the fire, which if thou shalt withdraw\u000aso often until the redness is made pure, then it will associate with thee, by whom it was cherished, and\u000ain whom it rests.\u000a4. Return then, O my son, the extinct coal to the water for thirty days, as I shall note to thee; and\u000ahenceforth, thou art a crowned king, resting over the fountain as known to thee, and drawing from\u000athence the Auripigment dry, without moisture. And now I have made glad the heart of the hearers, and\u000athe eyes looking unto thee in hope of that which thou possessest.\u000a5. Observe, then, that the water was first in the air, then in the earth; restore thou it, also, to the\u000asuperiors by its proper windings, and alter skillfully before collecting; then to its former red spirit let it\u000abe carefully conjoined.\u000a6. Know, my son, that the fatness of our earth is sulphur, the auripigment, siretz, and colcothar,\u000awhich are also sulphur; of which auripigments, sulphurs, and such-like, some are more vile than others,\u000ain which there is a diversity; of which kind also is the fat of glewy matters, such as are hair, nails, hoofs,\u000aand sulphur itself, and of the brain, which too is auripigment; of the like kind also are the lion\u2019s and\u000acat\u2019s claws, which is siretz; the fat of white bodies, and the fat of the two oriental quicksilvers, which\u000ahunt the sulphurs and contain the bodies.\u000a7. I say, moreover, that this sulphur doth tinge and fix, and is the connection of the tinctures; oils\u000aalso tinge, they fly away, which in the body are contained, which is a conjunction of fugitives with\u000asulphurs and albuminous bodies, which hold also and detain the fugitive Ens.\u000a8. The disposition sought after by the philosophers, O son, is but one in our egg; but this in the\u000ahen\u2019s egg can, by no means, be found. But lest so much of the Divine Wisdom as is a hen\u2019s egg should\u000abe extinguished, its composition is from the four elements, adapted and composed.\u000a9. Know, my son, that in the hen\u2019s egg is the greatest proximity and relationship in nature; for in it\u000athere is a spirituality and conjunction of elements, and an earth which is golden in its tincture.\u000a\u000aPage 10\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000a10. The son, enquiring of Hermes, saith -The sulphurs which are fit for our work, whether are they\u000acelestial or terrestrial? And he answers, certain of them are celestial, and some are terrestrial.\u000a11. The Son - Father, I imagine the heart in the superiors to be heaven, and in the inferiors earth.\u000aBut saith Hermes - it is not so; the masculine truly is the heaven of the feminine, and the feminine is the\u000aearth of the masculine.\u000a12. The Son - Father, which of these is more worthy than the other, to be the heaven or to be the\u000aearth? He replies - Each needs the other; for the precepts demand a medium. As if thou should say that a\u000awise man governs all mankind, because every nature delights in Society of its own kind, and so we find\u000ait to be in the Life of Wisdom where Equals are conjoined. But what, rejoins the son, is the mean\u000abetwixt them? To whom Hermes replies - In every nature there are three from two, first the needful\u000awater, then the oily tincture, and lastly the faeces or earth which remains below.\u000a13. But a Dragon inhabits all these and are his habitation; and the blackness is in them, and by it\u000ahe ascends into the air. But, whilst the fume remains in them, they are not immortal. Take away\u000atherefore the vapour from the water, and the blackness from the oily tincture, and death from the faeces;\u000aand by dissolution thou shalt achieve a triumphant reward, even that in and by which the possessors\u000alive.\u000a14. Know, my son, that the temperate unguent, which is fire, is the medium between the faeces\u000aand the water, and I the Perscrutinator of the water. For the unguents are called sulphurs, because\u000abetween fire and oil and the sulphurs there is a very close propinquity, even as so the fire burns, so does\u000athe sulphur also.\u000a15. All the wisdoms of the world, O son, are comprehended in this my hidden Wisdom, and the\u000alearning of the Arts consists in discovering these wonderful hidden elements beneath which it hides\u000acompleted. It behoves him, therefore, who would be introduced to this our hidden Wisdom, to free\u000ahimself from the vice of arrogance; and to be just and good, and of a profound reason, ready at hand to\u000ahelp mankind, of a serene countenance, to be courteous, diligent to save, and be himself a guardian of\u000athe secrets of philosophy open to him.\u000a16. And this know, that except one understandeth how to mortify to induce generation, to vivify\u000athe Spirit, to cleanse and introduce Light, until they fight with each other and grow white and freed from\u000atheir defilements, as blackness and darkness, he knoweth nothing, nor can he perform anything; but if\u000ahe knoweth this, he will be of great dignity, so that the kings shall reverence him. These secrets, son, it\u000abehoves us to guard and conceal from the wicked and foolish world.\u000a17. Understand also, that, our Stone is from many things and of various colours, and composed\u000afrom four elements, which we ought to divide and dissever in pieces, and segregate in the limbs; and\u000amortifying the same by its proper nature, which is also in it, to preserve the water and fire dwelling\u000atherein, which is from the four elements and in their waters, to contain its water; this, however, is not\u000awater in its true form, but fire, containing in a pure vessel the ascending waters, lest the spirits should\u000afly away from the bodies; for, by this means, they are made tinging and fixed.\u000a18. O blessed watery pontic form, that dissolvest the elements! Now it behoves us, with this\u000awatery soul, in order to possess ourselves of the sulphurous Form to mingle the same with our Acetum.\u000aFor when, by the power of the water, the composition is dissolved, it is the key of the restoration; then\u000adarkness and death fly away from them, and Wisdom proceeds.\u000aSECTION THIRD\u000a1. Know, my son, that the philosophers bind up their matter with a strong chain, that it may\u000acontend with the Fire; because the spirits in the washed bodies desire to dwell therein and rejoice in\u000athem. And when these spirits are united to them, they vivify them, and inhabit them, and the bodies hold\u000athem, nor are they separated any more from them.\u000a2. Then the dead elements are revived, the compounded bodies tinge and are altered, and operate\u000awonderful works which are permanent, as saith the philosopher.\u000a3. O permanent watery Form, creatrix of the regal elements! who, having united to thy brethren\u000aand by a moderate regimen obtained the tincture, findest rest.\u000a4. Our most precious stone cast forth upon the dunghill, being most dear is made altogether vile.\u000aTherefore it behoves us to both mortify two Argent vives together, and to venerate the Argent vive of\u000aAuripigment, and the oriental Argent vive of Magnesia.\u000a5. But when we marry the crowned king to our red daughter, and in a gentle fire, not hurtful, she\u000adoth conceive a son, conjoined and superior, in it, and he lives by our fire. But when thou shalt send\u000aforth fire upon the foliated sulphur, the boundary of hearts doth enter in above it, let it be washed from\u000athe same, and the refined matter thereof be extracted. Then is he transformed, and his tincture by help of\u000a\u000aPage 11\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000athe fire remains red, as flesh. But our son, king-born, takes his tincture from the fire, and death even and\u000adarkness, and the waters flee away.\u000a6. The Dragon, who watches the crevices, shuns the sunbeams, and our dead son will live; the\u000aking comes forth from the fire and rejoices in the espousal; the occult treasures will be laid open and the\u000avirgin\u2019s milk whitened. The son, already vivified, is become a warrior in the fire and over the tincture\u000asuper-eminent. For this son is himself the treasury, even himself bearing the Philosophic Matter.\u000a7. Approach, ye sons of Wisdom, and rejoice; let us now rejoice together; for the reign of death is\u000afinished and the son doth rule, and now he is invested with the red garment, and the purple is put on.\u000aSECTION FOURTH\u000a1. Understand ye Sons of Wisdom, the Stone declares: Protect me, and I will protect thee; give me\u000amy own, that I may help thee.\u000a2. My Sol and my beams are most inward and secretly in me. My own Luna, also, is my light,\u000aexceeding every other light; and my good things are better than all other good things; I give freely and\u000areward the intelligent with joy and gladness, glory, riches, and delights; and what they ask about I make\u000ato know and understand and to possess divine things.\u000a3. Behold, that which the philosophers have concealed is written with seven letters: for Alpha\u000afollows two, viz. Yda and Liber; and Sol, in like manner follows: nevertheless, if desirous to have\u000adominion to guard the Art, join the son to Buba, which is Jupiter and a hidden secret.\u000a4. Hearers, understand: and then let us use our judgement, for what I have written I have with\u000amost subtle contemplation and investigation demonstrated to you; the whole matter I know to be one\u000aonly thing. But who is he that understands the true investigation and inquires rationally into this matter?\u000aThere is not from man anything but what is like him; nor from the ox or bullock; and if any creature\u000aconjoins with one of another species, that which is brought forth is like neither.\u000a5. Now saith Venus: I beget light, nor is the darkness of my nature; and if my metal were not dry\u000aall bodies would desire me, for I liquefy them and wipe away their rust, and I extract their substance.\u000aNothing, therefore, is better or more venerable than I and my brother being conjoined.\u000a6. But the king, the ruler, his brethren attesting, saith: I am crowned, and I am adorned with a\u000adiadem; I am clothed with the royal garment, and I bring joy and gladness of heart; for, being chained to\u000athe arms and breast of my mother and to her substance, I cause my substance to keep together; and I\u000acompose the invisible from the visible, making the occult matter to appear. And everything which the\u000aphilosophers have hidden will be generated from us.\u000a7. Hear then these words, and understand them; keep them, and meditate thereon; and seek for\u000anothing more: Man is generated from the principle of Nature whose inward substance is fleshy, and not\u000afrom anything else. Meditate on this letter and reject superfluities.\u000a8. Thus saith the philosopher: Botri is made from the Citrine, which is extracted out of the Red,\u000aand from nothing else; and if it be Citrine and nothing else know it will be thy Wisdom. Be not\u000aconcerned if thou art not anxious to make extract from the Red. Behold, I have written to the point, and\u000aif ye understand I have all but opened the thing.\u000a9. Ye sons of Wisdom! burn then the Brazen Body with an exceeding great fire; and it will imbue\u000ayou with the grace which ye seek. And make that which is volatile so that it cannot fly from that which\u000aflies not. And that which rests upon the fire though itself a fiery flame, and that which in the heat of the\u000aboiling fire is corrupted is Cambar.\u000a10. And know ye that the Art of this permanent water is our brass, and the colouring of its tincture\u000aand blackness is then changed into the true red.\u000a11. I declare before God, I have spoken nothing but the truth. The destroyers are the renovators,\u000aand hence the corruption is made manifest in the matter to be renewed; and hence the melioration will\u000aappear and each side is a signal of the Art.\u000aSECTION FIFTH\u000a1. My son, that which is born of the crow is the beginning of this Art. Behold, I have obscured the\u000amatter treated of by circumlocution, depriving it of light. I have termed this dissolved, and this joined,\u000athis nearest I have termed furthest off.\u000a2. Roast those things, therefore, and boil them in that which comes forth from the horse\u2019s belly,\u000afor seven, fourteen, or twenty-one days. Then it becomes the Dragon eating his own wings and\u000adestroying himself; this being done, let it be put in a furnace, which lute diligently, and observe that\u000anone of the spirit may escape. And know that the periods of the earth are in the water which is bound\u000auntil you put the bath upon it.\u000a\u000aPage 12\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000a3. The matter being thus melted and burned, take the brain thereof and triturate it in most sharp\u000avinegar till it become obscured. This done, it lives in the putrefaction; the dark clouds which were in it\u000abefore it died in its own body will be changed. This process being repeated, as I have described; it dies\u000aagain as I said, thence it lives.\u000a4. In the life and death thereof we work with the spirits; for as it dies by the taking away of the\u000aspirit, so it lives in the return and is revived and rejoiced in them. Being arrived then at this, that which\u000aye have been searching for is made apparent. I have related to thee the joyful signs, that which doth fix\u000ait own body.\u000a5. But these things, and how they attained to the knowledge of this secret, are given by our\u000aancestors in figures and types; I have opened the riddle, and the book of knowledge is revealed; the\u000ahidden things I have uncovered and have brought together the scattered truths within their boundary,\u000aand have conjoined many various forms, even I have associated the Spirit. Take it as a gift of God.\u000aSECTION SIXTH\u000a1. It behoves us to give thanks to God, who bestows liberally to the wise, who delivers us from\u000amisery and poverty. Along with the fullness of his substance and his provable wonders I am about to try\u000aand humbly pray God that whilst we live we may come to Him.\u000a2. Away the, O sons of Science, with unguents extracted from fats, hair, verdigrease, tragacanth,\u000aand bones, which are written in the books of our fathers.\u000a3. But concerning the ointments which contain the tincture, coagulate the fugitive and adorn the\u000asulphurs, it behoves us to explain their disposition more at large. It is the Form of all other unguents in\u000awhich is the occult and buried ungent, and of which there appears to be no preparation. It dwells in his\u000aown body, as fire in trees and stones, which by most subtle art and ingenuity it behoves us to extract\u000awithout combustion.\u000a4. And know that the Heaven is joined mediately with the Earth; but the middle nature, which is\u000athe Water, is a Form along with the Heaven and the Earth. But the water holds of all the first place\u000awhich goes forth from the Stone; the second is gold; but the third is our almost or medial gold which is\u000amore noble than the water with the faeces.\u000a5. But in these are the smoke, the blackness, and the death. It behoves us, therefore, to drive away\u000athe vapour from the water, the blackness from the unguent, and death from the faeces, and this by\u000adissolution. Which being done we have the sovereign philosophy and secret of all hidden things.\u000aSECTION SEVENTH\u000a1. Know ye then, O Sons of Science, there are seven bodies - of which gold is the first, the most\u000aperfect, the king of them, and their head - which neither the earth can corrupt nor the fire devastate, nor\u000athe water change; for its complexion is equalized, and its nature regulated with respect to heat, cold and\u000amoisture; nor is there anything in it which is superfluous, therefore the philosophers have preferred and\u000amagnified it, saying that this gold, in relation of other bodies, is as the sun amongst the stars, more\u000asplendid by his light; and as, by the will of God, every vegetable and all the fruits of the earth are\u000aperfected through it, so gold, which is the ferment Ixir, vivifies and contains every metallic body.\u000a2. For as dough, without a ferment, cannot be fermented, so when thou hast sublimed the body and\u000apurified it, separating the uncleanness from the faeces, thou wilt then conjoin and mix them together,\u000aand put in them the ferment confecting the earth with the water until the Ixir ferment even as dough\u000aferments. Think of this, meditate and see how the ferment in this case doth change the former natures to\u000aanother thing; observe, also, that how there is no ferment otherwise than from a kindred nature.\u000a3. Observe, moreover, that the ferment whitens the confection and hinders it from combustion,\u000aand holds the tincture lest it should fly, and rejoices the bodies, and makes them intimately to be joined\u000aand to enter one into another, and this is the Key of the philosophers, and the end of their works; and by\u000athis science bodies are meliorated and the operation of them, God assisting, is consummated.\u000a4. But, through negligence and a false opinion in the matter, the operation is perverted, as bad\u000aleaven on the dough, or curds for cheese, and musk among aromatics.\u000a5. The colour of the golden matter points to redness, and the nature thereof is not sweetness;\u000atherefore we make of them Sericum, i.e. Ixir; and of them we make the encaustic of which we have\u000awritten, and with the king\u2019s seal we tinge the clay, and in that have set the colour of heaven which\u000aaugments the sight of them that see it.\u000a\u000aPage 13\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000a6. The Stone, therefore, is the most precious gold without spots - evenly tempered, which neither\u000afire, nor air, nor water, nor earth is able to corrupt; the Universal Ferment rectifying all things by its\u000acomposition, which is of the yellow or true citrine colour.\u000a7. The gold of the wise, concocted and well digested, with the fiery water, makes Ixir; for the gold\u000aof the wise is more heavy than lead, which, in a temperate composition is the ferment Ixir, and,\u000acontrariwise, becomes distempered by an equal composition.\u000a8. For the work begins from the vegetable, next from the animal, as in the egg of the hen, in which\u000ais the great support; and our earth is gold, of all which we make seriacum, which is the ferment Ixir.\u000a\u000aPage 14\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aCHAPTER THREE\u000aCOMMENTARY\u000aIn selecting the psychological method to elucidate The Golden Treatise of Hermes, I have been guided\u000asolely by personal predilection. For the Six Keys of Eudoxus I have reserved the magnetic and magical\u000ascheme as more appropriate. The former treatise is peculiarly adapted to psychological treatment,\u000ayielding interesting and significant material. In fact one could almost imagine that the unknown author\u000awrote his text with just such a viewpoint in mind. What has impelled me to analyse and interpret these\u000atexts is the hope that a deeper motive or a greater significance may be discovered for psychological\u000apractice than the mere elimination and cure of neurotic symptoms. While, therefore, we may learn\u000anothing startling about method, Hermes has something significant and vital to teach us about the true\u000agoal and aim of psychotherapy. This is the justification for time and effort spent in elucidating these\u000aobscurities. In concluding her highly suggestive book on Alchemy, Mrs. Atwood has expressed the\u000aopinion that \u201cthe thresholds of ignorance are already overpast, and experiment is in need rather of a\u000amotive to dignify it than of practical machinery\u201d. Moreover, when we find a well-received modern\u000awriter on psychology, such as Geraldine Coster, insisting that Western psychology today is in need of a\u000anew impetus to a higher goal, then I hope it may be admitted that an examination of these intriguing\u000atexts on Alchemy will provide an impetus in the right direction.\u000aTurning now to the opening verses of The Golden Treatise, what strikes us first is the preliminary\u000ademonstration of the essential religious or spiritual nature of the undertaking. It strikes a keynote of the\u000aentire treatise, raising the level of the interpretation of its subject matter considerably above the merely\u000aphysical. Almost it implores the student to seek for a higher and loftier point of view than usually\u000aobtains. In her examination of the Yoga sutras of Patanjali, Geraldine Coster makes the contribution\u000athat not only does resignation to God imply a devotion to a personal deity conceived of in the\u000aconventional sense, but rather more. To resign oneself patiently to God\u2019s will, or to acknowledge as\u000aHermes does that he obtained this knowledge by the \u201cinspiration of the living God alone, who judged fit\u000ato open them to His servant\u201d, implies a thorough-going acceptance of the whole of life, so that there is\u000ano place for conflict. It suggests an unconditional acquiescence in life as actually it is, an acceptance of\u000aoneself with all one\u2019s faults and vices. It intimates a willingness to sacrifice all other aims to the one\u000aend, the attainment of the Philosopher\u2019s Stone.\u000a3. The First Matter of the Alchemists is a synthesis or Quintessence of the four elements or\u000aqualities of dryness and moisture, heat and cold. Nothing can be done to perfect the Stone until this\u000ainterior subtle or design body is first known and then subjected to a decomposing process so that its\u000acrystallization and inflexibility is brought to naught. The colours to be passed through refer to the fact\u000athat in all occult systems a different colour is attributed to each specific item of the magical alphabet.\u000aUsually for the elements we have black, russet, or dark green for earth, blue for water, yellow for air,\u000ared for fire. But in the alchemical working another, possibly a simpler, attribution is employed. The\u000asequence runs - first black to represent the decomposition or putrefaction of the Stone as first it is\u000afound. Then white - its first purified and refined state. This is followed by greenness which expresses\u000aimmaturity and the possibility of complete spiritual growth, as witnessed by the colour displayed by\u000aNature in Spring; the colour of expectancy and hope. Red succeeds this, red for maturity, full growth,\u000aand ripeness; whilst citrine or yellow, the colour of gold and of value and worth, is the final and desired\u000aresultant.\u000a4. Here the First Matter is called Water. Elsewhere, and in other texts, it is named \u201cA stone which\u000ais not a stone, spirit, soul and body, which if thou dissolvest, it will be dissolved; and if thou\u000acoagulatest, it will be coagulated; and if thou dost make it fly it will fly, for it is volatile and as clear as\u000aa tear.\u201d\u000aHere are described the nature of the alchemists\u2019 basic material and the divisions made upon it. The\u000afour substances of the verse refer to he four elements of Earth, Air, Water and Fire. \u201cOne to two\u201d\u000arepresent the automatic division of the homogenous magical Agent into its polarities of male and\u000afemale, the two poles of positive and negative, active and passive, etc., the two opposites which pervade\u000aand characterize the whole of nature. These are the two extremes between which, in its unenlightened\u000astate, the ego constantly swings like a pendulum. It is this extreme which has to be overcome\u000apsychologically.\u000a\u201cThree to One\u201d are the alchemical principles of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury - the three modes of\u000aoperation of the One Thing, the True Quintessence. This Water is compromised of intelligence Mercury; feeling - Sulphur; and energy-substance - Salt.\u000a\u000aPage 15\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000a5. This is obscurity and vanitas vanitatis. These further veils are deliberately employed, we are\u000aconstantly assured, in order to confuse the ignorant and unworthy. The humidity possibly refers to the\u000amagical Earth, Meridian Redness is Fire, citrine Seyre is Air, and Auripigment is Water. The instruction\u000asimply names the ingredients of the Stone.\u000aThe Vine of the Wise is the perfected and purified Stone. It bears comparison with the opening\u000averses of the 15th chapter of the Gospel of St. John:\u000aI am the true Vine and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit\u000ahe taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.\u000aNow ye are clean through with the word which I have spoken unto you. Abide in me, and I in you.\u000aAs the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide\u000ain me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth\u000aforth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing.\u000aThe Vine yields wine for man\u2019s pleasure. But it does so only through the application of an\u000aintelligence and a skill external to itself. Itself unaided, it remains but a vine. So by the alchemical\u000aartifice of putrefaction and distillation, the crude material of the astro-mental sheath is purified,\u000abecoming, so to speak, the wine or spirit thereof. Noteworthy also, is the fact that the Vine and wine\u000agenerally are sacred in mythology to Bacchus. On the Qabalistic Tree of Life he is referred to Tipharas,\u000athe solar centre, the source of reference of all the dying Gods who teach immortality, resurrection, and\u000ahealing. The glorified and purified consciousness which is the Philosopher\u2019s Stone is likewise a\u000aTipharas attribution - and often is termed the Augoeidês, the deathless solar body, the wedding garment\u000aof scripture. Thus the Stone is immortality, it is consciousness resurrected from death, gifted with divine\u000ahealing.\u000a6. The method of working is here summarily described. Luna is the celestial symbol of the Astral,\u000athe philosophical Water, and therefore of the Collective Unconscious. In every system of ancient\u000asymbolism, the Moon refers to the Soul of the World. The first part of the operation, represented by the\u000awaning of the moon, the dark fortnight, is the breaking down process - decoction, putrefaction, which\u000adissolves the matter, and discharges all and every impurity. The second half is the bright fortnight, the\u000awaxing of the Moon - the reverse half of the \u201cSolvé et Coagula\u201d formula, the reconstruction, the\u000acoagulation of the volatile.\u000a8. Argent-vive is Mercury which, naturally, is within man himself, in the innermost chamber of\u000ahis being. It is the world of the psyche itself. Another definition is given by Hermes. He calls it the\u000aresidual Earth; that is Holy Earth. Here we have a reference on the Tree to the sphere of the operation\u000aof the four elements. Another name for it is the unredeemed Virgin, the animal Soul in its natural state.\u000aYesod the upper half of the seventh sphere on the diagram represents the state of the first purification, of\u000awhich the term Quintessence can be used. \u201cIf you have found this argent vive, which is the residuum of\u000athe philosophic earth after the purification, keep it safely, for it is worthy.\u201d Also note the\u000aencouragement that Vaughn gives, for he says: \u201cIf thou dost know the First Matter, know also for\u000acertain that thou hast discovered the Sanctuary of Nature. There is nothing between thee and her\u000atreasures but the door. That indeed must be opened.\u201d\u000a10. On the Tree of Life there are several other Sephiros of which but little mention has heretofore\u000abeen made. It will now be found useful to consult the chart. The uppermost three spheres called the\u000aSupernals are often classed together as a unit. As such, this triad is then governed by the attributions of\u000athe third Supernal Binah, which synthetically represents the Supernals. Binah means Understanding,\u000aand as a glyph of the Triad conceals Wisdom and the essence of the divine Light. Thus the Supernals\u000aare Spirit, the so-called Light itself, the concealed and unknown higher Self in man.\u000aOne of the astrological attributions to Binah is Saturn, among whose correspondences are such\u000aideas as stability, peace, blackness, death, time, etc. Notoriously the Vulture is a bird of prey, living on\u000acorpses and refuse. Hence, it is a particular idea or a symbol that can be included within the larger\u000aabstract generalisation of Saturn. The versicle we are dealing with reads. \u201cA Vulture stands upon the\u000amountain.\u201d Constantly recurring in all mystical literature is this theme of a mountain. The Psalmist\u000alifted up his eyes to the hills, Moses obtained the books of the law on Horeb. Jesus ascended the\u000amountain to deliver his sermon. It refers evidently to an illumined or heightened state of consciousness,\u000ato spiritual heights of exaltation. It is that inward divine peak when, turned inwards in meditation and\u000aprayer, the soul withdraws to its own root and source of perfection.\u000aIn addition to being that bird which preys upon deceased and putrefying things - represented in\u000aAlchemy by the corroded First Matter - the Vulture is also a maternal symbol. Binah has another\u000acorrespondence or association, the Great Mother. She it is who gives birth to the divine newly formed\u000a\u000aPage 16\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aStone, after her surrogate symbol, the Vulture, that is illumination and the lapse of time, has devoured\u000a(changed) the substance of which it is formed. The Vulture in its travels flies extremely high, and is\u000acapable of wheeling about slowly, seeming often to remain poised and stationary in mid-air. It is also\u000acredited with extremely clear and penetrating vision, sensing its prey from a distance of many miles. For\u000aour purposes then it represents extraordinarily clear and penetrating insight, intuitive understanding and\u000athe \u201cimmovable\u201d illuminating Spirit within.\u000aAs the Supernals are conceived of as the Light, white in colour, the vulture\u2019s speech becomes\u000amoderately clear. Malkus, the secondary meaning of the seventh sphere, is the residual earth and is\u000ablack, whilst the Supernals, which are the highest extreme of the Tree, represent the same residual earth\u000abrought to transcendental perfection - to whiteness. \u201cRed of the white\u201d would convey a further ripening\u000aof that process, of bringing it ineluctabley to maturity and ripeness. The citrine is the colour of gold, the\u000aperfect metal, Tipharas, the sphere of harmony and balance. It is neither transcendental nor terrestrial\u000abut he reconciliation of both, the child of the extremes, the integrated consciousness between, the\u000aMiddle Way. The Supernals are divine wisdom and understanding, the Truth itself.\u000a11. The Crow is the so-called bird of Hermes - the volatile astro-mental body, capable of\u000asustained and prolonged flights of ideation and fantasy. It requires no wings; it is Air itself.\u000aThe throat is the seat of the voice, the instrument of the expression of the mind. Speech is the logos\u000aof thought, giving evidence of thought. The tincture is clearly a mercurial extract, a thought-extract - it\u000ais therefore that intellectual ferment which eventually transforms consciousness. Moreover, the throat is\u000athe seat of Daas, the unnumbered centre on the Tree which is made manifest in man as evolution\u000aproceeds, as self-consciousness and perfection are developed. Because of its colour, the bird refers\u000amore particularly to that aspect of the psyche which is the unredeemed animal soul Malkus. It is evident\u000athat Red represents Sulphur, intensity of feeling and emotion and it \u201ccometh from him\u201d as we ascend\u000athe Tree. \u201cAnd from his back is taken a pure Water\u201d - that is Yesod again, the Quintessence, the water\u000aof the Wise, \u201cthe viscous humidity made by the dissolution which radically dissolves all metals, and\u000areduces them into their first ens, or water\u201d.\u000a12. Again, we have definitions of the First Matter and of the Stone - a classical and oft-repeated\u000adefinition particularly. The alchemists considered the discovery of the First Matter so important that\u000aalthough unwilling or unable to give absolutely clear indications of its nature, they were anxious\u000aconstantly to throw out suggestive hints. It was their belief that study and meditation would expand such\u000ahints into tangible ideas.\u000a\u201cThe cavern of the metals\u201d evidently refers to the interior depths of Man, the principles of whose\u000aexternal form are the metals drawn from the mineral kingdom. As such it is an excellent symbol for the\u000aUnconscious.\u000a13. Here now we have the first instructions as to the practical nature of the hermetic work. The\u000aFirst Matter, which is to say the hard, inflexible condition of consciousness encased in its crystallized\u000asheath, must be subjected to heat, and boiled. By these means the dryness and crystallizing qualities of\u000athe etheric substance are destroyed, leaving only the essential root nature of the substance, devoid of the\u000arigid and restricting attributes imposed upon it by the natural self-willed life.\u000aTo refer yet again to Miss Coster, we find the following clue to the meaning and significance of\u000aheating and boiling :\u000aIt is the nature of the human mechanism to set or harden into fixities of habit, and this is true\u000anot only of the body but of the mind and emotions. Speaking figuratively, it is as though the mentoemotional nature tended to harden like the stuff in an old glue-pot. The material must be brought to\u000aa perfectly homogeneous fluid consistency, and the relaxation of habitual restraint is comparable to\u000aa melting process.\u000aI am inclined to believe that this last analogy would meet with the approval of the alchemical\u000awriters themselves, though I tend to the belief that rather more is implied by the technical use of the\u000aword \u201cfire\u201d in our text.\u000aAn internal agent is mentioned which is the secret fire of the alchemists. It is the effect of this fire\u000awhich, it is said, reduces the silver-grey substance of the astral vehicle to dark ashes, the black Saturn.\u000aHere is the central secret of the alchemical art. All the operations depend upon this caloric operation the\u000aregimen of the Fire. Almost ad nauseam are we given reiteration and emphasis of this fact. Yet no\u000asingle text gives a clear straightforward indication either as to its real nature or the means of its\u000akindling. Even the symbols employed are of such a catholic and generic nature that they can be made to\u000ayield almost anything.\u000a\u000aPage 17\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aWe determined previously that the dynamic nature of the feelings and emotions could well be\u000asymbolized by fire, particularly in view of poetic expressions and widely employed colloquialisms and\u000alocal idioms. On the other hand, from a philosophical point of view, we could equally argue that\u000abecause of its penetrating, incisive and illuminating quality the intellect might be that fire so beloved of\u000athe alchemists. This would imply that they were thinkers and philosophers almost after the fashion of\u000athe Schoolmen, delighting in sophistries and intellectual quibbles. With these symbols, it is obvious,\u000ahowever, that we make but little real progress.\u000aTurning for aid to the psychological realm we are confronted with a maze of symbols which some\u000aconsider illuminating, whilst others in all sincerity and intellectual honesty believe to be of no final\u000avalue. For example, the Freudian interpretation of the nature of the furnace, the fire, and the oven is\u000aexclusively in terms of sex. That is to say, objects such as the furnace or the oven represent the female\u000agenitalia. Heat itself is, according to Freud's manner of seeing things, sexual excitation or libido, which\u000ahe defines solely in terms of sexual desire Popular expression known to almost everyone certainly\u000alends some degree of credence to the idea of heat as sexual desire. In his Introductory Lectures on\u000aPsychoanalysis, Freud observes that:\u000aThe kindling of fire and everything connected with this is permeated through and through with\u000asexual symbolism, the flame always standing for the male organ, and the fireplace or the hearth for\u000athe womb of the mother.\u000aAn analysis of the alchemical text along these lines would lead us finally to the conclusion that the\u000aunknown author was indulging consciously or otherwise in a sexual phantasy. Hence a detailed analysis\u000aof it would produce nothing of any ultimate psychological or practical value other than providing us\u000awith a new set of symbols for the sexual organs and the sexual act and infantile fantasies concerning\u000atheir use. It is, I am quite willing to agree, a valid line of interpretation. And, in point of fact, it was\u000aalong such lines as these that I proceeded when dealing with alchemy in a former work. In the 16th\u000achapter of my Tree of Life I produced as symbolical of the penis and semen the ideas of the alchemical\u000aAthanor and the Blood of the Red Lion. The Curcurbite and the Gluten of the White Eagle were\u000asymbols to represent the female genitals and their secretion. But adolescent fantasies of this kind are of\u000ano deep spiritual significance. They teach us nothing with regard to the object enunciated as my\u000aprincipal interest. We learn nothing of practical means of integrating the human psyche, of developing\u000aits latent faculties, of elevating it to a loftier level of function and psychic action. I discard therefore\u000awithout further argument the Freudian interpretation unless it be subjected to considerable modification\u000aand extension.\u000aIf we do accept the furnace as being a female symbol, then, instead of halting desperately here, we\u000amust proceed along an extended association track to discover other valid meanings and significations\u000afor such ideas. The sexual correspondence is a perfectly valid objective association. It is accurate as far\u000aas it goes. But its meaning is considerably enhanced if we transfer it to the subjective level - that is if we\u000aascertain what is the symbolic meaning, either to the dream faculty or the active imagination, of women\u000aand their sexual organs. So far as man is concerned, women represent three things: First, their primary\u000areaction to life is an emotional one; it is always expressed in terms of feeling, love, and emotion.\u000aSecond, they represent sexually an object of gratification. Third, as the mother they represent the source\u000aof human life. Thus we have several correspondences for the alchemical furnace and the fire it\u000agenerates. It represents something whose action is generative, from which pleasure may be derived, and\u000awhich has a definite association with the emotional faculties. It may be contended, therefore, that if we\u000aassociate the furnace with the Unconscious we have a valid and reliable correspondence. The female\u000asymbol is the furnace-Unconscious, whilst the .masculine one is the fire-libido. In my opinion a\u000aconsideration of the text along broader lines such as these will yield infinitely more meaning and\u000apractical information than if we adhered to what is in reality an adolescent fixed and unscientific code\u000aof symbol attribution.\u000aDr. Jung, who differs very considerably from Freud's rather narrow sexual interpretations, has\u000asomething to say on this question of fire in his Commentary to The Secret of the Golden Flower.\u000aReferring to the Chinese text, he remarks that\u000aThese verses contain a sort of alchemistic instruction as to a method or way of creating the\u000a\u201cdiamond body\u201d, which also appears in our text. \u201cHeating\u201d is necessary; that is, there must be a\u000aheightening of consciousness in order that the dwelling-place of the spirit can be \u201cilluminated\u201d. But\u000anot only consciousness, life itself must be heightened. The union of these two produces \u201cconscious\u000alife\u201d. According to the Hui Ming Ching, the ancient sages knew how to bridge the gap between\u000a\u000aPage 18\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aconsciousness and life because they cultivated both. In this way the immortal body is \u201cmelted out\u201d\u000aand in this way \u201cthe great Tao is completed\u201d.\u000a15. Here follow further instructions on the Stone, each one, by meditation. revealing some further\u000apoint in clarification of the issue. Again we have technical references to a method to be pursued. The\u000aHeavenly Flyer is consciousness, the human soul so-called. The Fire is the internal re-creative agent,\u000asuggesting an intensity of feeling and emotion. On the other hand, the action of a keen and penetrating\u000aintellect, which burns up dross and confused thinking, may will be likened to Fire.\u000aQuite valid at this juncture are the psychological correspondences, and they follow the same routine\u000aas we followed above. Generally speaking, free association will produce the Mother as an association of\u000aSea. The Mother is the source and root from which we have come; that which has given us birth.\u000aTransferring the objective symbol to the purely subjective level, the Mother as an idea is related to the\u000aUnconscious. It is axiomatic that consciousness is a more or less recent development in the long history\u000aof man, and the Unconscious is its source and antecedent. Consciousness is born from and issues out of\u000athe dark creative fertile depths of the Unconscious. The Unconscious, wrote Jung, is always there\u000abeforehand as a potential system of psychic functioning handed down by generations of men.\u000aConsciousness, however, is a late-born descendant of the unconscious psyche. It would certainly show\u000aperversity if we tried to explain the lives of our ancestors in terms of their late descendants; and it is just\u000aas erroneous and stupid to regard the unconscious as a derivative of consciousness. We are much nearer\u000athe truth if we put it the other way round.\u000aIn this event, we must enlarge the psychological idea of the Unconscious very considerably. We\u000ahave identified this Collective Unconscious with what in occultism is called the Anima Mundi. But even\u000ain magical literature this latter concept is conceived to have two aspects or poles, if so we may speak.\u000aTo explain their nature, we may be obliged to use in addition to the word Unconscious another term not\u000ain general acceptance, the Superconscious. This includes all the finer spiritual aspirations, inner\u000afaculties of discrimination and innate wisdom and love. Both of these principle concepts have become\u000aunited in the general term, the Unconscious. So long as we understand this, no harm may come. But it\u000awould be erroneous to suppose literally that consciousness has issued from the lower levels of the\u000aAnima Mundi. This latter is itself a derivative - so runs magical philosophy - of the higher more divine\u000alevel, corresponding to the supernal triad of Spirit and Wisdom and Understanding.\u000aBut before consciousness can attain to the Supernals, it must have passed through Avernus. And\u000athis is the implication of the text. Consciousness and feeling together must, by no matter what means, be\u000aimmersed in the fructifying sea of the Unconscious. Naturally, this would appear at first as a destructive\u000aprocess. For as Jung has so concisely expressed it:\u000aDanger arises whenever the narrowly delimited but intensely clear individual consciousness\u000ameets the immense expansion of the Collective Unconscious, because the latter has a definitely\u000adisintegrating effect on consciousness.\u000aThis species of disintegration, of conscious schizophrenia,. is precisely what the alchemists wish to\u000aproduce as their first step. For one thing, if the process is accomplished deliberately and consciously,\u000athe larger part of the danger is eliminated. In fact to do so implies an understanding of the mechanism of\u000athe unconscious. And such a knowledge, psychotherapists inform us, confers freedom from unconscious\u000aautomatisms, from compulsive domination of consciousness by repressed material stored in the\u000aUnconscious, and also from the dangers of any such lack of insight and discrimination.\u000aTheir practical experience has taught them, the alchemists aver, that if the immersion of the\u000aheavenly flyer in the Sea where lies latent the internal fire be repeated sufficiently often, then instead of\u000adestruction being effected, the nascent spirit stirs to renewed activity. The German poet Holderlin has\u000awritten : \u201cDanger itself fosters the rescuing power.\u201d\u000aAnd moreover, to quote Jung once more:\u000aWhat we observe here is a fundamental law of life - enantiodromia - the reversal into the\u000aopposite; and this it is that makes possible the -reunion of the warring halves of the personality, and\u000athereby brings the civil war to an end.\u000aThe result of this renewal of life is a second birth. For the elements of consciousness, or the human\u000asoul and its vehicle, are reassembled spontaneously upon an entirely new and higher pattern. This new\u000aconsciousness is the result of the union of the several constituents of consciousness, or levels of\u000a\u000aPage 19\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aawareness. Its major characteristic is the absence of any hard-and-fast barrier or partition which\u000aconsciousness has erected before the portals of the Unconscious. A harmony is established between the\u000ahuman soul and infinite life without. The result is the ability of the natural vital spirit to flow freely into\u000aall the parts and levels of the whole consciousness, producing health and true happiness and integrity.\u000aAlchemists frequently quote Francis Bacon with regard to this law of enantiodromia, as follows:\u000aAnd if any skilful minister shall apply force to nature; and, by design, torture and vex it in\u000aorder to its annihilation, it, on the contrary, being brought to this strange necessity, changes and\u000atransforms itself into a strange variety of shapes and appearances; for nothing but the power of the\u000aCreator can annihilate it or truly destroy; so that, at length, running through the whole circle of\u000atransformation and completing its period, it in some degree restores itself, if the force be continued.\u000aIt is the spontaneous reversal of the spiritual life, the restoration of itself after continuous and\u000apersistent attempts to dissolve the frame and groundwork of the soul which the alchemists believed to\u000aoccur, and claimed, furthermore, to have achieved.\u000a17. The perfected inner body restored spontaneously to itself by its own inherent dynamic power,\u000aglows and scintillates outwardly with an inward light like a diamond or other very precious jewel. It is\u000ainteresting here to quote Aleister Crowley's description of the aura, which is the glorified inner body\u000atogether with its own dynamic emanation:\u000aThe Aura should be clean-cut, resilient, radiant. iridescent, brilliant, glittering. \u201cA Soap\u000abubble of razor steel, streaming with light from within\u201d, is my first attempt at description ; and it is\u000anot bad, despite its incongruities.\u000aIt is the opinion of the Zürich school that the development of this inner or diamond body is the\u000aautomatic adjustment on the part of the psyche itself in its preparation for death. Jung declared that such\u000aa development is \u201cpsychologically symbolical of an attitude which is invulnerable to emotional\u000aentanglements and violent upheavals; in a word they symbolize a consciousness freed from the world. I\u000ahave reasons for believing that this is a natural preparation for death. and sets in after middle life. Death\u000ais psychologically just as important as birth and, like this, is an integral part of life\u201d. And a little further\u000aon, the same psychological exponent refers to the \u201cpsychic spirit-body ('subtle body') which ensures the\u000acontinuity of the detached consciousness\u201d. As our text puts it,, with regard to this newly found but still\u000ahighly concealed stone, \u201cit leads from darkness into light, from this desert wilderness to a secure\u000ahabitation, and from poverty and straits to a free and simple fortune\u201d.\u000aThis is that celebrated Elixir of Life which, freed from every restriction on the part of an inelastic,\u000aconfused, and unseeing mentality, is said to prolong life - though we need not necessarily interpret this\u000ain a wholly physical sense . It is a truism in certain philosophies that man is not immortal though his\u000aessence is. His immortality as an individual conscious entity is a condition of things that requires\u000aachievement through his own unaided and unfailing effort.\u000aCertain comparative philosophical views are worthy here of consideration. Notably, the Buddhist\u000aidea as contrasted with typical Western ideas. As is more or less well known, all schools of Buddhism\u000ahold that man has no individual ego or permanent unit of consciousness which is capable of surviving\u000adeath, as is maintained both by Hindu philosophers and those of the West. Whilst in Buddhism the idea\u000aof transmigration or reincarnation is held, the rationale or modus operandi departs considerably from\u000athe usually held idea that it is the immortal ego which incarnates again and again. It is the Buddhist\u000aclaim that man is comprised of various bundles or aggregates of attributes and qualities. Their view,\u000amoreover, is that man is a combination of several consciousnesses strung together by natural law to\u000aform an apparent unit. So far as his ego-sense is concerned, their psychology holds it to be a false\u000aperception. It is a convenient expression to speak of the ego just as commonly we still refer to the rising\u000aand setting of the sun. Such a view is directly attributable to taking appearances on their face value and\u000aignoring the true nature of reality. It is precisely this ego-sense, false and illusory, which impedes the\u000aperception of the true nature of reality, of the universe as it is in and for itself. From such a point of\u000aview it follows that the goal to be sought-since this false ego-sense is responsible for an imperfect view\u000aof life and thus responsible for suffering, mental conflict and psychic torture - is the dissolution of that\u000aobstinate and persistent falsity. This accomplished by various means, the aggregate, which is called\u000aman, sinks into the Void. Buddhism considers the Void most certainly not as a negative conception of\u000anothingness, but rather as analogous to transcendental divinity, the Clear Light, or absolute\u000aConsciousness.\u000a\u000aPage 20\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aIn the West, however, ignorant though we may be of the loftier flights of the philosophic and\u000aspiritual perception indubitably enjoyed by the protagonists of the Mahayana Bodhi, our point of view\u000ais fundamentally different. It is the Occidental view that the ego has some value for us in that we are\u000aindividual human beings obliged by our destiny to deal with a very practical world. Therefore the\u000aegocentric concept has been preserved despite all arguments and efforts to the contrary. This is not to\u000asay that our philosophers fail to realize the defects and inadequacies and occasional lapses of the ego\u000aitself. On the contrary this is clearly recognized. The Western religious and philosophic ideal seems to\u000abe the enlightenment of the mind by God or the Absolute or the Universal Spirit removing the tarnish\u000afrom the bright mirror of the mind. It tends to nullify the false accretions which a worldly civilization\u000abuilds around the ego itself. The ego as a separate practical psychic entity they seek to preserve in its\u000aown right that it may consciously manifest to the world the divine consciousness which informs it. \u201cLife\u000aand yet more life\u201d is the prevalent ideal here. And illumination which sanctifies life through a purified\u000aand clarified consciousness seems to be, summarily speaking, the central pivot of its system - god and\u000aman Conjoined in a single being.\u000aAlchemy, in Europe. has acquired a singularly Occidental flavour, and this too is pretty much theAlchemical ideal. To manifest and use the Stone of the Wise for the further glory of God is that ideal.\u000aIts virtue over and above other Western systems is that it provides a practical scheme to this end. A\u000aglorified body with a purified spirit and soul elevated to the heights of spiritual kingship - a glorified\u000ainner pneumatic body used by a regenerated soul - is the attainment it holds up. No final dissolution\u000adoes it countenance, or an absorption at the expense of the ego. This, in its eyes, would imply the\u000aextinction of the individual.\u000aAt the outset of the second section Hermes again emphasizes the essentially spiritual attitude\u000arequired of him who would undertake this divine work. Were Alchemy a mere torturing and vexing of\u000amaterial metals, such a stand would be absurd. And, moreover, our author shows by what means the\u000aknowledge of the divine art may be obtained. For whilst all the alchemists urge that nothing can be\u000aknown of the spagyric art save by the grace of God, yet Hermes states the entire process is a rational\u000aone and urges constant reflection and meditation on rational principles. This being so the art must be\u000aaccessible to rational inquiry if conducted in the right way and if persisted in so as to penetrate the\u000aconvention of the apparently arbitrary use of obscurities. Meditation above all must lead to the solution\u000aof the great problem. Together with diligent study of his protracted instructions, aided by sincerity,\u000adevotion and a complete acceptance of life and human nature, meditation will lead far if conducted with\u000aor motivated by a true spiritual motive. Hermes urges that reflection on the matter is of tremendous\u000aimportance and persisted in will impart the vital clues. For, says he, consider the text as though you, the\u000areader, had written it. In such a way, one may identify oneself with the motive of the writer and sense or\u000aintuit his purpose. Consider the writer's motive for the employment of the various phrases and\u000aconventionalities of expression. Probe into the significance of his various instructions and \u201cso let thy\u000aheart be fitted\u201d for the truth.\u000a2. Having premised this much, at once the venerable adept dives into the obscure deeps of\u000aalchemical intricacy. The \u201crust\u201d of the verse is, evidently, the crippling superficial world-view of the\u000aindividual, which corrupts and corrodes consciousness and its experience of life. Infantility, compulsive\u000abehaviour, adherence to adolescent expression both of feeling and thinking - these are the traits which\u000ainterfere with the free growth and expression of the psyche. Not only so, but if persisted in, and if they\u000abecome chronic or severe or intense, we have the production of psychosis, true schizophrenia, and other\u000aforms of insanity - rusts which eat up the metal of consciousness and involuntarily disintegrate the ego\u000aitself.\u000aTherefore we are to take consciousness, which in view of the airy volatile nature of the mind is\u000anamed by the text as the Flying Volatile, and drown it flying. The curious use of the last phrase is most\u000aintriguing. It seems to indicate the specific nature of the technique employed. That is to say\u000aconsciousness is to be drowned by its own activity - whilst it flies. It would point to the immersion of\u000aconsciousness in the Sea - \u201cdrowning\u201d points in that direction - by its own intellectual and critical\u000aactivity. Analytical therapy would most certainly correspond to such an activity. Certain forms of\u000ameditation likewise function in much the same way. Often, during the course of analysis, the patient\u000abecomes quite unsettled and disturbed. The analytical process consists of an impartial critical\u000aexamination of the memory, fantasy, feeling and the other contents of consciousness in order to divine\u000atheir origin and significance, and thus to estimate their true value. Moreover the contents of the\u000aUnconscious well up from the hidden depths and make their appearance at various stages either in\u000adream or by direct perception and feeling. It may sometimes appear to the analysand, when he has\u000alearned a little of the art of mental relaxation and can actually loosen his emotional tension, that he is in\u000a\u000aPage 21\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000adanger of being swamped or overwhelmed by the wealth of unconscious image and ideation that arises.\u000aThe entire therapeutic process is accomplished by the active use of the consciousness whose contents\u000aare being examined and changed, and whose boundaries and horizon of vision are being enlarged and\u000aenhanced. By immersing consciousness in, at first sight, the disintegrating sea of the Unconscious, it is\u000adivided from \u201cits rust which yet holds it in death\u201d. That is, these infantile attitudes and fantasies which\u000aare so inhibiting and disturbing to consciousness are seen for what they are, and in the light of a\u000adawning understanding and discrimination are discarded.\u000aMental conflict, when unconscious, as usually it is, is. always inhibitory and leads to indecisive\u000aaction and loss of physical and mental tone. Conflict invariably, though not inevitably, arises from a\u000aone-sided and unbalanced attitude towards life. It arises either from a stressing of conscious viewpoints\u000aat the expense of those of feeling and emotion, or vice versa. Such an attitude may lead to a sudden loss\u000aor withdrawal of libido. All our previous activities may become uninteresting, even senseless, and the\u000agoals towards which we strive lose their value.\u000aConscious conflict, however, has another value, quite apart from the superficial fact that a\u000aconscious conflict can consciously be dealt with. Our text appears to encourage conflict when,\u000ahowever, it is cultivated deliberately and with full intent in order to hasten the cessation of its activity.\u000aThen follows a new birth and production of an integrated attitude which appertains to neither element of\u000athe conflict. What possibly is a more accurate expression is not that conflict is encouraged consciously\u000aor otherwise, but that analysis and meditation increase the perception of the presence of the conflict so\u000athat the true extent of the internecine warfare waging within is fully realized. Jung has described at\u000asome length in Psychological Types the phenomenon whereby the conflict between the pairs of\u000aopposites when becoming too acute to be borne, causes consciousness of them to undergo an eclipse. A\u000athird or higher reconciling point of view spontaneously comes to birth and is the outcome of\u000asurmounting or growing out of a psychic position which is untenable and unendurable.\u000aWhilst this battle royal proceeds, every care must be taken to prevent consciousness from flying off\u000aat a tangent, an escape, a defensive operation of the self-preservation mechanism. The hysterical escape\u000afrom one opposite to another, from the sea beneath into the \u201cregions above\u201d, must be checked, the pain\u000aand torture of the conflict being accepted and endured. Then, says the text, the hysterical symptoms of\u000aescape pass away and disappear, and the flying volatile will truly forbear to fly. Patiently will it endure\u000athe appalling unsettling of itself, the threatened disintegration of its own being, with the quiet stoicism\u000aof a sage. And it does so primarily because of its full acceptance of itself and of the conflict raging\u000awithin.\u000aFairly obvious is the result. If the analysand can endure the exposure of his inner life, the\u000adestruction of long-cherished points of view, the elimination of beloved yet loathsome symptoms and\u000abehaviour, by arriving consciously at an understanding of his own realized self, by how much is he not\u000aenriched.\u000aThe rest of the text is comparatively clear. In making conscious and assimilating with intent the\u000awealth of content domiciled in the Unconscious, the vast inspiration, the peace and power,\u000aConsciousness itself is enhanced. And it becomes a suitable companion. The psyche thus integrated and\u000amade whole is indeed \u201ca conquering lord, with it adorned\u201d.\u000a3. Because of the highly specialized nature of consciousness, its exaggerated independence and\u000aself-satisfaction and the guilt sense resulting therefrom, a barrier is erected in the psyche of modern man\u000abetween the several levels of consciousness. The treatise calls this barrier set up by persistent\u000arepression, \u201cthe shadow and impurity by which the clouds hang over it, defile and keep away the light\u201d.\u000aIn fact, it is common evidence that many neurotics, feeling themselves cut off from their roots and thus\u000afrom the vibrant stream of life about them, imagine that actually clouds do hang over them, darkening\u000atheir lives. Freud calls this overshadowing cloud of self-criticism and recrimination the Super-ego. It\u000aprevents a free and adequate contact with people and things, dulls the brain, inhibiting the easy flow of\u000alife and light, the libido, from welling up from the Unconscious. The ray is, I take it, the light itself\u000ashining over and into consciousness after the latter has been separated from or has deliberately absorbed\u000a(accepted) its shadow.\u000aIt is because of the psychic inhibitions, the \u201cconstrictions\u201d of Hermes, that consciousness becomes\u000ainflamed and feverish within the narrow boundaries to which it is confined by repression - the fiery\u000aredness. These burn the psyche, causing it to become restless and costive, unable to accept and adapt\u000aitself to life, ill-capable of functioning smoothly and easily. Repression might be an alternative word to\u000athat employed by Hermes.\u000aThe Water is the Unconscious - using the latter in its widest sense to include not only the realm of\u000ainstinct and emotion but also of the highest intuition and wisdom. It is the domicile, so to say, of the\u000alibido, vital energy, the fire of life. The association of water with fire seems curious. It recalls other\u000a\u000aPage 22\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aalchemical allusions, such as \u201cthe fire of thy water.\u201d. And again, \u201cInwardly at its (water) heart there\u000aburns purest infernal fire.\u201d Likewise The Golden Treatise speaks of the \u201cwater, which is as a live coal\u000aholding the fire\u201d.\u000aInvariably a neurosis is caused by repression of certain at one time conscious material. Thrust into\u000athe deepest portions of the psyche, this material remains as an autonomous unit, fed by libido, and\u000arendered a powerful complex of ideas. Gradually, by association, this latter extends itself. Nervous and\u000aphysical symptoms of disorder, as well as psychic compulsions, owe their existence to the repressed\u000acomplex refusing, as it were, to abide quietly and peacefully in the Unconscious. It becomes explosive\u000aand dangerous. And since it has become associated with other variegated ideas, innocuous in\u000athemselves and which are not necessarily to be repressed, it forces an entry into consciousness by a\u000abackdoor method. These repressions torment and constrict the psyche. Its integrity and sense of security\u000ais attacked. The therapeutic mode of release is to become aware of what in the past has happened and\u000awhat is now happening to oneself, and no longer to repress what really must be expressed in daily life.\u000aThe unconscious material, set free and assimilated rationally into consciousness, is relieved of its\u000aexplosive tendency, and thereby becomes, so to speak, purified. It no longer seeks a forcible exit.\u000aTo face the neurosis or repression frankly, and thus to accept it, robs it of its terror, lifting it out of\u000athe unconscious psyche where it became charged with psychic energy emerging continuously from the\u000avery deepest parts of the self. Released from the unconscious where it had obtained vitality and life, the\u000ainhibited material no more acts on consciousness in a compulsive way. No longer does it seek vengeful\u000aexpression outside its normal and proper sphere. That is to say, the dynamic stimulus of the\u000aUnconscious is withdrawn from the inhibitions and fiery redness, the neurotic symptoms or distressing\u000aqualities of the ego, and the \u201credness is made pure\u201d. The symptoms subside, or else resume their usual\u000afunction in the psychic economy. They \u201cassociate with thee by whom it was cherished, and in whom it\u000arests\u201d.\u000aThe rationale of the process is purification by understanding. To understand the Unconscious is at\u000aonce to be freed from its domination.\u000a4. The symptoms having subsided by the pursuit of this technique - by the assimilation of\u000aUnconscious material - the psyche having regained its integrity, and strengthened by the vast accretion\u000aof libido brought up by the released material, is definitely enriched. It is freed to the point where\u000aHermes is justified in speaking of it as a crowned king. It rests over an inexhaustible fountain of life, for\u000asuch is the nature of the Unconscious and the life-force which ever flows through it.\u000a5. Here is an injunction with regard to the component principles of our Philosophic Water - the\u000aUnconscious. The elements themselves require stimulation and purification before being reconstructed\u000ain the proposed new and perfected form. In ancient magical systems of initiation the candidate had to\u000apass through so-called elemental initiations. The spirits of the element were invoked in four specific\u000arites, each one relating to a different element. And the impact of their power upon the psyche of the\u000acandidate purified him, awakening within the psychic realm a dormant faculty corresponding to the\u000anature of the element. The true power of the element is also imparted to the interior astral form which is\u000abeing consolidated by the ceremonial system. But I shall deal more fully with the ceremonial aspect in a\u000alater chapter.\u000a\u201cConvert the elements,\u201d says Arnold of Villa Nova, \u201cand you shall have what you desire.\u201d And\u000aMrs. Atwood elaborates by adding: \u201c'Separate matter into its. essential relationships and join them\u000atogether in harmonious proportion.\u201d Whilst Jung writes in The Secret of the Golden Flower.\u000aWithout doubt, also, the question of making the opposites conscious (conversion) means\u000areunion with the laws of life represented in the unconscious or, expressed in Chinese terms, the\u000abringing about of Tao (the conscious way of union).\u000aThe phrase, \u201crestore thou it, also, to the superiors by its proper windings\u201d, is, I believe, a\u000asignificant phrase. For this reason. The Qabalistic Tree of Life, which we have decided to use as our\u000ameans of reference, may be looked at from several angles. One of the simplest methods of classification\u000ais by means of the elements. That is to say Keser is considered to be Air, Chokmah is Fire, and Binah is\u000aWater. These three constitute the first and most important triad. It is considered that this triad -reflects\u000aitself downwards so that the elements make a sort of criss-cross pattern. Thus we have Chesed reflecting\u000athe Water from Binah, Gevurah reflecting the Fire from Chokmah and Tipharas reflecting the Air down\u000athe Middle Pillar from Keser. This completes the second triad, which again reflects itself downwards as\u000ain a mirror. Netzach reflects the Fire from Gevurah, Hod, the Water from Chesed, and Chesod, the Air\u000afrom Tipharas. Here we have the third triad, which reflects itself and forms a new element, the\u000a\u000aPage 23\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000acombination and base of all the others, Earth in Malkus. Thus, as the simplest means of classification,\u000athe entire universe and man himself may be understood in terms of the operation of the four elements.\u000a\u000aTo restore therefore the elements to their superiors\u000aKeser\u000abecomes comparatively clear in view of the above\u000a1\u000aFire\u000aWater\u000ascheme. Sublimation is clearly referred to. The spiritual\u000aenergy the life force manifesting through the\u000aBinah\u000aChokmah\u000aUnconscious, must gradually be referred back to its\u000aAir\u000a3\u000a2\u000amanifest antecedent and this further back, until finally we\u000areach its ultimate source or a very lofty degree of\u000aexpression. The possibility of sublimation is likewise\u000aWater\u000aFire\u000arecognized in Psychotherapy. For where energy and\u000aGevurah\u000aChesed\u000aattention is wasted in unproductive and antisocial habits,\u000a5\u000a4\u000aby cultivating a more creative and socially useful one the\u000aformer bad habit is eliminated by the deviation of the\u000aTipharas\u000alife-giving force from its channel. The magical view goes\u000a6\u000aWater\u000aFire\u000adeeper, however, and holds out a better hope of true\u000aHod\u000aNetzach\u000ausefulness.\u000aAir\u000a8. The egg of the philosophers refers to the aura,\u000a8\u000a7\u000athe ovoid emanation exuding from and surrounding the\u000aYesod\u000aastro-mental form. It is this shape which is the subject of\u000a9\u000athe work. When brought to fulfilment, it glows and\u000ascintillates most brilliantly like some more than precious\u000aAir\u000agem.\u000a11 and 12. These verses obtain particular interest in\u000athe light of the research done and nomenclature decided\u000aMalkus\u000aupon by Dr. Jung. I make reference here to his terms\u000a10\u000aanima and animus, parts of the personality.\u000aWhen speaking of the masculine which is \u201cthe\u000aFig.2 - The Elements on the Tree\u000aheaven of the feminine\u201d, Hermes refers to what Jung\u000awould consider the animus. It is the ideal principle operative in a woman's psyche, as is the anima in\u000aman. He declares: \u201cMind makes up the \u2018soul', or better the animus of woman . . . (it) consists of inferior\u000ajudgments, or better said, opinions . . . (it) consists in a plurality of pre-conceived opinions . . . (it) is an\u000ainferior logos, a caricature of the differentiated mind.\u201d\u000a\u201cThe feminine is the earth of the masculine\u201d without a doubt corresponds to the anima. \u201cThe\u000aemotional nature of man (his inferior not superior function, not his mind) corresponds to the conscious\u000anature of woman.\u201d That is therefore, the ground whereon his conscious psyche may function. Anima\u000aJung further defines \u201cas an image, or archetype or as the resultant of all the experiences of man with\u000awoman. . .\u201d It represents the emotional and feeling aspect of his psyche. \u201cI have defined the anima in a\u000aman,\u201d continues he, \u201cas a personification of the unconscious in general, and have therefore taken it as a\u000abridge to the unconscious, that is, the function of relationship to the unconscious.\u201d See also the two\u000alarge coloured diagrams in Vol. I of The Golden Dawn, which extend these concepts.\u000a13. A vast amount of material exists in early psycho-analytical literature on the subject and\u000asignificance of the Dragon. A great deal of this is well synthesized in The Psychology of the\u000aUnconscious by Jung. Briefly it may be said that the Dragon refers to the instincts, to undomesticated\u000alibido. We have already defined the libido not as sexual desire alone as the Freudians claim, but as the\u000asum total of all psychic energy, the life force peculiar to any organism. Undomesticated libido would\u000atherefore represent that portion of psychic energy which has not yet been recognized and hence\u000aemployed by consciousness. In consequence, it remains in a crude, undeveloped,, unutilized and\u000aundomesticated state. Adding to this condition the psychic state of fear and anxiety which so to speak\u000apoisons this energy, it comes to represent a source of real danger to the individual. Whatever within\u000acannot be dealt with invariably becomes a psychic projection, an objective something which the\u000aundeveloped psyche can suppress, or from which it may make frantic efforts to escape, or deal with in\u000aother ways.\u000aAll primitive and archaic concepts of the devil, satan, evil, etc., represent just such projected or\u000aobjectified psychic energy that has not been recognized nor included within the scope of the ego.\u000aIgnorance as to its true nature gives rise to further fear, and this emotion invests the psychic object with\u000ainnumerable qualities and predicates born and bred from fantasy. The dragon, which is precisely such a\u000a\u000aPage 24\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aprojection of feared because untamed psychic energy and content., is symbolic of the instinctual nature.\u000aIt represents enormous power and dynamic energy, the emotional drives and urges which are at the\u000afoundation and root of all conscious development. Accepted and thus brought within the possibility of\u000adevelopment and utilization - for denial and repression transforms it into a fearful life-rending monster it serves as a trained and faithful beast whereupon the psyche may ride and proceed upon its individual\u000aevolution.\u000aOne alchemical commentator defines the dragon as \u201cthe self-willed spirit, which is externally\u000aderived into nature, by the fall into generation\u201d. That is to say, summarily, the instinctual life divorced\u000afrom the higher and intellectual faculties.\u000aIn another text Coelum Terrae by Thomas Vaughan, given in Book Three of this work, there is the\u000afollowing with reference to the nature of the Dragon:\u000aI am a poisonous dragon, present everywhere and to be had for nothing. My water and fire\u000adissolve and compound. Out of my body thou shalt draw the Green and the Red Lion; but if thou\u000adost not exactly know me thou wilt - with my fire - destroy thy five senses. A most pernicious,\u000aquick poison comes out of my nostrils which hath been the destruction of many. Separate therefore\u000athe thick from the thin artificially, unless thou dost delight in extreme poverty. I give thee faculties\u000aboth male and female and the powers both of heaven and earth. The mysteries of my art are to be\u000aperformed magnanimously and with great courage, if thou wouldst have me overcome the violence\u000aof the fire, in which attempt many have lost both their labour and their substance. I am the egg of\u000aNature known only to the wise, such as are pious and modest, who make of me a little world.\u000aOrdained I was by the Almighty God for men, but - though many desire me - I am given only to\u000afew, that they may relieve the poor with my treasures and not set their minds in gold that perisheth.\u000aI am called of the philosophers Mercury; my husband is gold philosophical. I am the old dragon\u000athat is present everywhere on the face of the earth. I am father and mother, youthful and ancient,\u000aweak and yet most strong, life and death, visible and invisible, hard and soft, descending to the\u000aearth, and ascending to the heavens, most high and most low, light and heavy. In me the order of\u000aNature is oftentimes inverted - in colour, number, weight and measure. I have in me the light of\u000aNature; I am dark and bright; I spring from the earth and I come out of heaven; I am well known\u000aand yet a mere nothing; all colours shine in me and all metals by the beams of the sun. I am the\u000aCarbuncle of the Sun, a most noble clarified earth, by which thou mayst turn copper, iron, tin, and\u000alead into most pure gold.\u000aOur present text states that all the principles of man are polluted by the dragon - by an anxiety and\u000afear-laden Unconscious. The instinctual expression at the base of the individual life when ill-understood\u000ais distinctly poisonous and dangerous. It is evident that every attempt to classify such a condition must\u000abe in terms of evil and blackness. Hence a blackness pollutes the very nature of man so long as he\u000aremains subject to the unconscious psyche, and dominated by its impulses - which latter in any event, by\u000areason of repression and confused thinking and feeling, are false and untrue. Even the mind, rational\u000aand logical as it may seem, is not exempt from this pollution. Its very habits and its \u201cexact\u201d methods of\u000athinking, its intellectual predilections, are coloured and compulsively motivated by the emotional\u000arepressions. As Hermes remarks, \u201cBy it (the blackness) he (the dragon) ascends into the air\u201d - air being\u000athe element representing the intellectual and rational life. So long as this unrighteous condition prevails,\u000aby just so long is man deluded as to the real nature of the universe and of his own interior possibilities.\u000aIt prevents him from ever becoming aware of his destiny, and of integrating himself. This perpetual\u000atendency to schizophrenia is precisely that which renders him mortal and incapable of living\u000aconsciously and divinely for his own high spiritual ends beyond physical death.\u000aHence our text advises us what to do. A dissolution of the entire emotional and mental nature is to\u000abe achieved before we can proceed. The hovering vapour is to be removed from the Water, from the\u000aPhilosopher's Mercury, which is the inner intelligence, before the latter can perceive life clearly and\u000aaccurately. The blackness requires elimination from the oily tincture - the emotions must be cleansed\u000aand purified following a full-blooded acceptance of their existence. Then they may shine forth in daily\u000alife for what they truly are, the fire of life. Death dies from the faeces, the substantial vehicle of the\u000aabove, by the same sort of achievement. As soon as the emotional and feeling principle functions\u000acleanly in its own right, and the mind's perceptions and functions are enhanced by a divorce from\u000aautomatic emotional and instinctual compulsion, then also their sheath undergoes a transformation. We\u000aknow what tremendous changes can be wrought upon the physical body through neurosis and\u000arepression. We are also aware how functional and organic diseases and neurotic symptoms fall away\u000a\u000aPage 25\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aunder psychotherapeutic treatment. How much more so should not the ethereal vestment of the inner\u000aman react to a more perfectly functioning psyche? Such is the reward promised by the Golden Treatise.\u000a14. Oils and sulphurs are here identified. Both become synonymous of the emotional life, and the\u000alibido which fires it. One commentator here remarks, \u201cThe knowledge of this secret sulphur, and how to\u000aprepare it and use it in this work includes the whole art of perfection. It is the stirrer-up of the whole\u000apower and efficacy and purifier of the matter; hence Hermes calls it the Perscrutinator, eminently\u000adistinguishing the Rational Ferment\u201d. Here our commentator prefers to look upon Sulphur as a mental\u000arather than an emotional principle.\u000a17. The Stone - the integrated and perfected mind functioning easily and unimpeded in a newly\u000aconstructed etheric vehicle-is quite evidently composed of various elements, etc. But in order to\u000aproduce the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, the elements as found in their natural state in the natural unillumined\u000aman, must be divided, dissevered, and broken down. For the elements in this world, so far from being\u000asimple, are compounded. There is no water that is only water; no fire that is only fire, nor any known\u000aearthly element that is complete or single by itself; no gas is complete in itself The elements, therefore,\u000ain this world are all now compounded, mortal, subject to division - adulterated and mixed. After\u000adividing and dissevering them, it will be possible to reassemble those principles and elements on an\u000aentirely new pattern for the further development of the individual.\u000a18. The disintegration accomplished, it is the freed mind united to its anima, forming a complete\u000aand reintegrated psyche, which is the key of the restoration. A new heaven and a new earth. No wonder\u000aHermes apostrophizes the virtue of this healing water! The regenerate soul does have the power to heal\u000aand to save - a mind cleansed by analysis, aware of its own true essence, made strong by the union with\u000aits anima, and filled with the influx of the awakened vital spirit, the libido. Here are the keys of\u000aWisdom.\u000a\u000aPage 26\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aCHAPTER FOUR\u000aCOMMENTARY (CONT.)\u000aTHOMAS VAUGHAN, in his Lumen de Lumine, describes the stage mentioned at the opening of the\u000athird section even more eloquently than Hermes: \u201cThou must incamp against them with the fire of\u000anature, and be sure thou dost bring thy line round about. Circle them in, and stop all avenues, that they\u000afind no relief. Continue this siege patiently.\u201d\u000aThe \u201cbinding\u201d that Hermes recommends must be a similar operation. It would refer to an advanced\u000astage of self-immersion, when consciousness is withdrawn from all the avenues of sense and perception.\u000aA meditation or introversion which has become deep and profound could be described in very much\u000athese terms. And if we refer to oriental texts and philosophies of Yoga and concentration, we shall\u000adiscover that it is in the deepest meditations that the spinal Spirit-Fire-which is called the Paraclete in\u000athe New Testament, Speirema by the Gnostics, and Kundilini by the Yogis - is aroused. It is in such a\u000adeep indrawn condition that the philosopher's matter contends with fire.\u000aThe psychological approach hereto would be that in profound states of introversion, when there is\u000ano leakage of the attention on the objective plane, the focus of the entire field of attention is directed\u000awithin. The levels of consciousness within the psyche itself become the object of perception. As a result\u000aof this inseeing, the contents of these levels became invaded by the stream of libido upwelling from the\u000adeepest levels of the Unconscious.\u000aSince the Unconscious has a vehicle of its own type of substance. then the \u201cwashed bodies\u201d refer to\u000athe vehicle of the Unconscious, and the \u201cspirits\u201d to the vital energic current of libido.\u000a4. In order once more to confuse the ignorant and unworthy, Hermes harks back to the beginning\u000ain this inconsequential way. Unconscious of the existence of the Stone of the Philosopher's within - no\u000abetter term than Unconscious could have been devised to express this condition of ignorance - how else\u000athat mankind should defile this great seminal treasure, the seed of immortality. Hence the allusion to the\u000adunghill.\u000aWe strain the psychological method to the point of breaking in our attempt to understand the\u000areference to two Argent-vives. We know that the process of analysis affects not only the patient or\u000aanalysand but also the analyst. Groddeck has gone so far as to say that it is the analyst who benefits or\u000alearns most. Jung also writes that the analyst\u000ais as much a part of the psychic process of the treatment as is the patient, and is equally exposed to\u000athe transforming influences. Indeed, if the doctor is more or less inaccessible to this influence, he is\u000acorrespondingly robbed of his influence over the patient; if he is influenced only consciously, he\u000ashows a defect of consciousness which prevents him from seeing the patient clearly. The fourth\u000astage of analytical psychology, then, demands not only the transformation of the patient, but also\u000athe counter application to himself by the doctor of the system which he prescribes in any given\u000acase.\u000aThere must be a mutual interplay and interaction between the Unconscious of both analyst and\u000apatient. For any lasting good to be done to the one, an effect must be produced in the other. Seen in this\u000alight., psychotherapy is a mutually conducted procedure of intense human value. No longer is it the cold\u000adistant scientific process envisaged some thirty years ago.\u000a5. We now approach rebirth symbolism of a curious pictorial and eloquent character. That the\u000aunion of male and female produces offspring in the biological world is a common place fact. But it has\u000asimilar application in the psychological world. The union of an integrated psyche - the \u201ccrowned king\u201d with the principle of instinct and felling - \u201cour red daughter\u201d, formerly latent and dormant within, must\u000abe a pleasurable and highly emotional experience. In literature written by mystics and religious\u000aenthusiasts we have panegyrics and emotional tributes to the bliss and ecstasy of the mystical\u000aexperience or divine union. Just as the abreaction of repressed material is accompanied by an emotional\u000astorm, so the union of these two psychic factors is likewise characterized by an intensity of feeling, and\u000aby a release of enormous energy expressing itself in terms of Light and Fire. A gentle fire, not hurtful. is\u000aquite an appropriate expression for such an intensity of feeling. The psyche conceives a spiritual child, a son, conjoined with and yet superior to both its parents. It is not, naturally, an objective product\u000avisible to the eyes of the world. But it inheres within the psychic domain as an integral part of the\u000apsyche, as a spontaneous effort to transcend itself in a higher, more inclusive synthesis. Just as the\u000acrowned king is the Ruach centred in Tipharas - the Sun is its Father - so the red daughter is a symbolic\u000a\u000aPage 27\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aglyph of the instinctive world in the guise of a female form - its Mother the Moon. So the child is Daás,\u000aknowledge, the Ruach reborn as the supernal child of the Middle Pillar, the direct result of the\u000aovercoming of the red dragon, the child of Wisdom and Understanding. Once more I must refer the\u000areader to the large coloured plates in Vol. I of The Golden Dawn.\u000aThe continuance of a life attitude in a balanced rational manner, adhering throughout to the middle\u000away, is calculated to produce an abiding peace, an inner contentment, and harmony. It is a sense of\u000aintense happiness and satisfaction radiating from some deep interior source. It is a realization of the\u000aharmony within accepting the harmony without. It is this tranquillity of soul and spirit which is the true\u000acharacteristic of integrity, of wholeness, of saintlike holiness. And it is this which stabilizes the newly\u000aformed Quintessence, the recently born child within.\u000aThe \u201cboundary of hearts\u201d is the object sought for and which satisfies when attained, remarks Mrs.\u000aAtwood. In this sense it represents the descent of the Light of the Supemals, an extraordinary\u000aheightening and clarification of consciousness. This heightening of consciousness accompanied by a\u000adeep intensity of feeling perpetuates and consolidates the attainment. As the text says, with reference to\u000athe Son, \u201cThen is he transformed, and his tincture by help of the fire remains red as flesh.\u201d It matures\u000aand ripens as an individual point of view - attaining full fruition as an habitual and not an occasional\u000ahigh outlook. Not only is this so but a marked effect is wrought on the invisible vehicle of\u000aconsciousness. In a former quotation from Thornas Vaughan's Coelum Terrae we found the following\u000aas a finale to an exalted panegyric: \u201cAll colours shine in me and all metals by the beams of the sun. I am\u000athe Carbuncle of the Sun.\u201d Hence the colour change manifesting in the aura must be predominately a\u000adeep-red one, so that it glows and emits a brilliant rubified light.\u000a6. Clearly the attainment spells the eclipse of the Dragon. Where light shines no darkness can\u000athere abide. For being the basis of the instinctual life, harnessed and chained to the needs and clearly\u000aperceived ideals of the psyche, the dragon shuns the sunbeams and the daylight. No longer do its\u000aprojections and compulsive automatisms haunt the light of consciousness. No longer is the personality\u000atortured as by some foul and evil presence. Its needs and dictates, once so imperious, cease their\u000aurgency, finding their proper place within the natural economy.\u000aThe \u201coccult treasures\u201d are, as the text itself makes clear, no more nor less than the manifestation of\u000athe Son. He is the Stone of the Philosophers - not yet, even now, however, brought to final perfection.\u000aBut at any rate the stage reached is so exalted as possibly to bring about the frequently encountered\u000afeeling that finality is reached. Using Christian symbolism, this would indicate that Christ has been born\u000awithin the heart, manifesting the glory of his godhead within the entire personality.\u000aHermes further remarks that \u201cthe virgin\u2019s milk is whitened\u201d. The alchemical Salt, the astral\u000asubstance of the interior design body, about to be glorified and made radiant, has not yet attained full\u000amaturity. The reference to virgin's milk again demands a quotation which is highly expressive and\u000ailluminative from Vaughan's Coelum Terrae with regard to the First Matter :\u000aIt is a most pure sweet virgin, for nothing as yet hath been generated out of her. But if at any\u000atime she breeds it is by the fire of Nature for that is her husband. She is no animal, or vegetable, no\u000amineral, neither is she extracted out of animals, vegetables, or minerals, but she is pre-existent to\u000athem all, for she is the mother of them. Yet one thing I must say: she is not much short of life, for\u000ashe is almost animal. Her composition is miraculous and different from all other compounds\u000awhatsoever. Gold is not so compact but every sophister concludes it is no simple; but she is so\u000amuch that no one man believes she is more. She yields to nothing but love, for her end is generation\u000aand that was never yet performed by violence. He that knows how to wanton and toy with her, the\u000asame shall receive all her treasures. First, she sheds at her nipples a thick heavy water, but. white as\u000aany snow; the philosophers call it Virgin's Milk. Secondly, she gives him blood from her very\u000aheart; it is a quick, heavenly fire; some improperly call it their sulphur. Thirdly and lastly, she\u000apresents him with a secret crystal, of more worth and lustre than the white rock and all her rosials.\u000aThis is she, and these are her favours; catch her, if you can.\u000a7. But the next verse carries us a step further. By itself, and with the passage of time, the Son\u000agrows and becomes reddened and full grown and mature. \u201cThe Son is invested with the red garment and\u000athe purple is put on.\u201d\u000aThis final stage is worthy of comparison with a description written by the great Gnostic poet\u000aBardesanes. He describes in a poem the descent of the soul into the realms of matter, and-its ultimate\u000areascent. G. R. S. Mead translated it as Vol. X of his Echoes from Gnosis Series, and it is a Hymn of the\u000aRobe of Glory. It is too long to quote in its entirety, but I give certain lines from the end:\u000a\u000aPage 28\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aI saw it (a bright robe sent by his parents) making itself ready.\u000aI heard the sound of its tones,\u000aAnd I perceived also in myself\u000aThat my stature was growing according to his labours.\u000aIt was spreading itself out towards me,\u000aIt hastened that I might take it on.\u000aAnd I stretched forth and received it,\u000aWith the beauty of its colours I adorned myself.\u000aAnd my toga of brilliant colours\u000aI cast around me, in its whole breadth.\u000aI clothed myself therewith, and ascended\u000aTo the Majesty of my Father who had sent it to me.\u000aAnd I was with him in his kingdom.\u000aAnd he promised me also that to the gate\u000aOf the King of Kings I should speed with him,\u000aAnd bringing my gift and my pearl\u000aI should appear with him before our King.\u000aThe opening versicle of the fourth section can best be understood, I think, by quoting Mrs.\u000aAtwood's footnote:\u000aThe fermenting light, by constant addition of the spirit, leavens more and more, increasing as\u000ait tends to the perception of the final cause in life. As Solomon, speaking of the Divine Wisdom,\u000asays, \u201cExalt her and she shall promote thee. She shall bring thee to honour when thou dost embrace\u000aher.\u201d (Prov. iv, 8-9.)\u000aAt the stage when the psychic integration has been achieved, it is needful that man should be so\u000asimple in his childlike and complete acceptance of life that he is attentive and obedient to the higher\u000adictates of his heightened consciousness. To disregard such dictates would in the long run be\u000atantamount wilfully to destroying the communion established between the different levels of the psyche,\u000aand would imply a return to the former neurotic condition. But by obedience, as it were, to himself, an\u000aunconditional acceptance of himself, he helps the Stone, his psyche. The result is that it helps him and\u000aprotects him so that all his works prosper and flourish. It is considerably reminiscent in certain senses of\u000athat mystical treatise The Light on the Path, where we read:\u000aStand aside in the coming battle, and though thou fightest be not thou the warrior. Look for\u000athe Warrior and let him fight in thee . . . . He is thyself, yet infinitely wiser and stronger than\u000athyself. Look for him, else in the fever and hurry of the fight thou mayest pass him, and he will not\u000aknow thee unless thou knowest him. But to know him and to protect him first, as in the case of the\u000aStone, is the essential that later he too may help and protect.\u000a5. Venus is a goddess of the same kind as Hera, Isis, Rhea, etc. All are anima figures - love\u000agoddesses, and from the Qabalistic point of view are referred to the Sephirah Binah, the Great Sea and\u000athe Mother. Venus and Aphrodite in Greek mythology are depicted as having sprung from the sea.\u000aThere is another series of correspondence which identifies Venus with the occult cohesive influence\u000ajoining Chokmah to Binah, the interior Father imago to the Mother, Wisdom to Understanding. As such\u000ashe must represent the love of the one for the other. And she represents as the higher love which is\u000aunderstanding, the means of entry into the interior Supernal life. We have here an adumbration of a\u000areligious or mystical technique of devotion. Bhakta or love is, according to many schools of mysticism,\u000athe supreme and ineffable means of divine union - that is to say of integration. Since Binah also is\u000aShekinah, the Holy Spirit; the manifestation of which is always described in the symbolism of fire and\u000alight, such symbolism also pertains therefore to Venus, as the text itself advises. Love and fire and the\u000ameans of integration have thus a necessary and categorical connection.\u000aIn Egyptian symbolism, Osiris was not only the husband but the brother of the heavenly Isis. From\u000atheir marriage the divine child Horus was born. The text repeats the desirability of such an incestuous\u000arelationship, referring to the newly arisen as Venus\u2019 brother and that nothing could be better or more\u000avenerable than that they should be conjoined.\u000aFrom the practical point of view, the analysand, after having achieved a certain degree of\u000aintegration through a union with his own instinctive and emotional processes, may well consider\u000a\u000aPage 29\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aanalysis and the process of development at an end. His too urgent emotional demands have become\u000aquiescent because understood, and his neurotic symptoms have subsided. But a higher principle still\u000aremains concealed and latent within. Mrs. Atwood's footnote to this verse is: \u201cAnd when she (Venus)\u000aappears, the artist is rejoiced, and thinks perhaps his work is finished, and that he has the treasure of the\u000aworld in hand; but it is not so; for if he tries it the light still will be found imperfect, alone, and\u000atransient, without the masculine tincture to fix it in manifestation.\u201d\u000a6. The attainment becomes fixed, as a permanent possibility by a further union. just as the first\u000astage comprised a unification of consciousness with its instinctual basis to form a united whole, so now\u000athe psyche must open itself to the Light and wisdom and understanding of the Supernals or to the\u000aprimordial archetypes of the Collective Unconscious. Such a union completes its nature, rendering it\u000acapable of enduring and persisting, since it has achieved a conscious union with its own eternal and\u000aimmortal essence.\u000aIn occult symbolism, a male force is spoken of as a sudden, sharp, and abrupt force, powerful yet\u000awithout the ability to persist. A female force on the contrary is slow, stable, receptive, and enduring.\u000aThe one is the throne or seat of activity of the other, and the best results, so far as lasting effects are\u000aconcerned, are obtained by uniting the two types of force. Hermes implies a similar union. For though\u000athe freed psyche, the king, is crowned and adorned with the diadem, it is only by being chained to the\u000aarms and breast of his mother - to Venus, his sister and wife, the higher soul - that his substance keeps\u000atogether. The love of Venus acts as a cohesive force, for otherwise the power of the king\u2019s attainment\u000awould soon be dissipated, and the virtue would soon depart from consciousness, which would thus exist\u000awithout a firm foundation.\u000a8. The simplest elemental attribution, discussed on a former page, helps a little here. Binah is the\u000aGreat Sea, the element of Water, and is therefore blue, but because of its Saturnine attribution is also\u000aindigo or black. Chokmah is Wisdom, and the element of Fire, red in colour. Whilst Keser is the spirit\u000aof Life, the source of all things, circulating in all things, and is referred to the element of Air, and its\u000acolour is yellow.\u000aThe verse recalls Mrs. Atwood\u2019s definition of the Hermetic Art. \u201cAlchemy is philosophy; it is the\u000aphilosophy, the seeking out of The Sophia in the mind.\u201d\u000aHermes says, \u201cBehold I have obscured the matter treated of by circumlocution, depriving it of light.\u000aI have termed this dissolved and this joined, this nearest I have termed furthest off.\u201d The Hermetic\u000aauthors indulged freely in circumlocution and every artifice of cunning in order to deceive the unwary\u000aand those they considered unworthy of their art. It is this that has made the study of alchemy so\u000adifficult.\u000aElsewhere, the crow has been defined as the Bird of Hermes. It signifies thereby the animal soul,\u000abrain, or body consciousness itself. On the other hand we would do well to consider every\u000acorrespondence or association that the word calls up. As a black bird, the colour is significant. Black is\u000athe colour of death, of evil, of impurity. Uniting the two concepts, it is evident that from several points\u000aof view consciousness is considered black or evil in its natural state, because it is precisely that which\u000ablinds our eyes to God as the alchemists would put it, or which prevents us from perceiving the true\u000anature of life. \u201cThe mind is the slayer of reality\u201d, another mystical book observes, counselling the\u000adisciple therefore \u201cto slay the slayer\u201d. This evokes that difference between Occidental and Oriental\u000aviews of religious aspiration which I had occasion to note above. It is a characteristic of the West to\u000amake goodness issue from that which is evil. If the mind blinds us to the true nature of reality, and is\u000aevil, does it behove us to destroy the mind itself? This idea was never compatible to the practical\u000aoutlook of the Western religious philosophers. They argued to the contrary. We know that the ego has\u000acertain uses and functions. In its own sphere it is a useful instrument built up through long aeons of\u000aevolution for our benefit. Let us then proceed from where Nature left off and perfect by our own\u000aachievement the instrument with which she has endowed us. If our present ego is evil, let us cleanse and\u000arefine this ego, eliminating the evil, the dross, and confusion so that, where it failed in its prior state, it\u000amay serve us faithfully and well when placed in its proper sphere. Similar is the attitude of Hermes.\u000aThough the crow, the black bird of sorrow and foreboding and ill-omen, the mind in all its complacency\u000aand confused chaotic thinking, is evil, nevertheless what it yields following its deliberate decapitation is\u000athe beginning of this art. The child of so awful a parent must possess enormous possibilities.\u000aAnother point of view, more mystical in nature, also presents itself in interpretation of the phrase\u000a\u201cwhat is born of the crow is the beginning of this art\u201d. Referring to a work by Porphyry, Mrs. Atwood\u000ajustly observes in her Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery that:\u000a\u000aPage 30\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aThere is a twofold death; the one indeed universally known, in which the body is liberated\u000afrom the soul; but the other peculiar to philosophers in which the soul is liberated from the body;\u000anor does the one entirely follow the other. That which nature binds, nature also dissolves; that\u000awhich the soul binds, the soul likewise can dissolve; nature, indeed, binds the body to the soul, but\u000athe soul binds herself to the body. Nature therefore liberates the body from the soul, but the soul\u000amay also liberate herself from the body. That is to say, if she know how, and have the right\u000adisposition awarded, she may dissolve her own conceptive vehicle, even the parental bond, and\u000areturn consciously (the elementary principles remaining, nor yet suffered to depart) under the\u000adominion of another law to life. That was the way to \u201cprecious death\u201d, spoken of by the Hebrews\u000aand Academics, this the \u201chappy gate of blackness\u201d celebrated by the old adepts, the \u201chead of\u000aHermes\u2019 crow\u201d, which is in the beginning of the work.\u000aThe emphasis here is placed on the art of meditation which, carried to the point when\u000aconsciousness is completely withdrawn into itself, induces a trance state in which all bodily form and\u000alimitation is surmounted so that it ascends to an intimate contact with divinity. Plotinus of the Neoplatonic school, and the methods of the Hindu Yogis, illustrate this point of view perfectly. Meditation\u000awas the means employed to penetrate the barrier of consciousness, thus permitting the vital stream of\u000alife and living experience to well up spontaneously from the unconscious levels of the mind.\u000a2. The horse is a universal symbol of the Mother. This again is an objective symbol for the\u000aUnconscious, the animal life, since it is from thence that consciousness is born. Again, the horse in\u000aastrological symbolism corresponds to the zodiacal sign Sagittarius which represents aspiration and\u000aspiritual yearning. Associated with this idea there is the Chaldean Oracle:\u000aAlso there is the Vision of the fire-flashing courser of Light, or also a child borne aloft on the\u000ashoulders of the celestial steed, fiery, or clothed with Gold, or naked, or shooting with the bow\u000ashafts of Light, and standing on the shoulders of the Horse. But if thy meditation prolongeth itself\u000athou shalt unite all these Symbols in the form of a Lion.\u000aNearly all animals, from the psychological viewpoint, indicate libido or instinct, the type and size\u000aof animal indicating the degree of its domesticity. Speed in running is the chief characteristic of the\u000ahorse. Its tendency when frightened to bolt with the bit between its teeth is another. These are fairly\u000adescriptive symbols of the primitive instinctive principle inhering within each one of us.\u000aThe alchemical writers inform us that those who search for urine and faeces are assuredly on the\u000awrong track. That which comes forth from the horse\u2019s belly is certainly urine and dung. But what is the\u000acharacteristic of these? What is the symbolical meaning denoted and played upon by these writers?\u000aClearly, they refer to a moist heat. It is this which renders explicable the phrase that Hermes employs.\u000aThe dissolved elements are transformed by a slow gentle heating into what is called the \u201cDragon\u000aeating his own wings and destroying himself\u201d. At this juncture, it is worth quoting a similar process\u000afrom Vaughan:\u000aContinue this siege patiently, and they turn into an ugly venomous black toad; which will be\u000atransformed to a horrible devouring dragon creeping and weltering in the bottom of her cave,\u000awithout wings. Touch her not by any means, not so much as with thy hands, for there is not upon\u000aearth such a vehement transcendent poison.\u000aWe have already defined the dragon as the libido, undomesticated, weighted down by the burden of\u000aanxiety, guilt, and fear, effects which are repressed into the Unconscious. The effect of this siege, of\u000aintroversion or meditation, is to turn anxiety against anxiety. The dissolved constituents of the brokendown astro-mental form vie and war one with another. During psychotherapeutic, or any medical\u000atreatment. for that matter, neurotic and psychotic symptoms apparently become much more severe.\u000aAnxiety increases to an alarming degree. In homeopathic treatment, any ailment is treated by such drugs\u000aand medicines as by themselves will duplicate the symptoms thrown up by the bodily system. Very\u000aoften a physical or psychic crisis precipitates itself - much to the consternation, at first, of the patient.\u000aThis psychic condition arrived at, the contents of consciousness, foul and sordid as they are - the scum\u000aon the glue-pot described by Geraldine Coster - evocative of shame, guilt, and anxiety when seen in\u000atheir starkness, must be subjected to yet further analysis. The infantile reactions so out of place in an\u000aadult must be discarded and destroyed. A species of meditation must be engaged upon. All the senses\u000amust be closed to outgoing stimuli. The consciousness and its attention are to be completely withdrawn\u000a\u000aPage 31\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aand focused inwards upon the hitherto hidden contents of its own nature. This is the furnace, the fire\u000abeing the concentrated attention brought to bear on consciousness by meditation and introversion.\u000a\u201cObserve that none of the spirit may escape\u201d may well imply that the critical attention is not to be\u000apermitted to wander from the unpleasant poisonous items included in consciousness. The libido must\u000anot leak out from this enclosed sphere of attention. It is all far too valuable. In any event, it comprises\u000aan integral part of the personality. And if any part, no matter how minute and apparently insignificant,\u000aof the spirit escapes that loss is irreparable and fatal to the concept of integrity and wholeness.\u000aSilberer in his Problems of Mysticism has a word or two which is useful here:\u000aPatient effort is required. Precipitancy is as great an evil as inactivity. It is just as bad to\u000ascorch the tender blossoms by a forced and hasty fire (that in spite of its intensity may be merely a\u000astraw fire) as to let go out the fire which should be continually kept alight, and to let grow cold the\u000aMercury. The process of distillation is to be accomplished slowly, so that the spirit may not escape.\u000aThere is another viewpoint of alchemy, an ethical one. which is worthy of consideration. It finds its\u000aexpression in:\u000aIn the alembic of thy heart,\u000aThrough the athanor of affliction,\u000aSeek thou the true stone of the wise.\u000aLife and everyday experience are, by this interpretation, the means of initiation. It is the impact of\u000alife upon the soul, and the transmutation of sorrow within which develops an even attitude as an\u000ahabitual reaction of the psyche. The heart here is the furnace, whilst affliction, that is to say the\u000aexperience generally of this world, is the initiating fire.\u000a3. As meditation and the introversion process deepen and become more profound, the heating of\u000athe psychic contents gives rise to a phenomenon which can only be described in terms similar to any\u000aphysical one. \u201cHot air rises.\u201d That is to say, concentration, like a fiery ray turned inwards, heats the\u000ainterior principles. The dormant libido, formerly confined to the depths of the sea, rises to the higher\u000alevels, to the surface of consciousness.\u000aWhat would be the effect of this libido ascent upon consciousness? Our text tells us. The brain,\u000aclearly, is the conscious intellectual life of the spirit. Sharp vinegar must without doubt refer to the\u000alibido, the vital living spirit. This assumption is justified in my mind by a significant allusion in a highly\u000amystical and devotional treatise. Here, the spirit is represented as speaking metaphorically to the ego, its\u000apersona. in these words: \u201cWolf's bane is not so sharp as steel; yet it pierceth the body more subtly. Even\u000aas evil kisses corrupt the blood, so do my words devour the spirit of man. I breathe, and there is infinite\u000adisease of the spirit. As an acid eats into steel, as a cancer that utterly corrupts the body; so am I unto\u000athe spirit of man. I shall not rest until I have dissolved it all.\u201d\u000aIn a word, consciousness is dissolved and eaten up by its impact with the upwelling libido from the\u000aunconscious psyche. Jung too observes that the impact of the narrow delirnited yet intensely clear\u000aconsciousness with the wide expanse of the Unconscious is disintegrative. Complexes and neurotic\u000asymptoms become changed considerably in their nature, which is to admit that the personality\u000aundergoes a marked transformation. The process, naturally, should be repeated again and again. Finally\u000athe point must be reached where in consciousness there is left no remnant at all of the elements causing\u000asuffering and conflict which formerly were so devastating and disturbing to the individual. Then only\u000acan a new life begin. Not until this freedom and liberation has been won can life be faced as it is, nor\u000athe nature of the world be seen in its true and intrinsic selfhood.\u000aAt the commencement of another cycle of recapitulation, Hermes reiterates the religious nature of\u000athe art, urging a spiritual point of view. How then could men have so deliberately misunderstood the\u000aterms of the art as to have fallen into the \u201ctorturing of metals\u201d? The mistaken steps of the \u201cPuffers\u201d, as\u000athe false alchemists are known, who worried themselves to death with metals, minerals, and the most\u000aoutrageous and unspeakable experiments, are here exposed by the author.\u000a3. He states deliberately that the magical Form, wherein is concealed the unguent or elixir of Life,\u000ais within man himself in exactly the same sense as combustion is latent in combustible natures. It only\u000aawaits evocation.\u000a4. The recapitulation proper is begun. Hermes signifies the two invisible poles of the\u000aquintessence wherein are implicit the three alchemical principles. The middle nature is the divine\u000a\u000aPage 32\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aMercury which reconciles the two opposites, and is the mediator between the heavenly fire of Sulphur\u000aand the earthy formative nature of Salt.\u000aBut, as the insistent author notes and has reminded us before, these principles and elements as they\u000aexist in their natural condition require unification. Nothing in nature is single and unadulterated. Gold\u000awhen found is valueless until the grime and grit have been washed off, and the gold itself refined.\u000aIn magical working the same process stands out with crystalline clearness. If the element Air is\u000arequired for invocation purposes in Temple, then as a preliminary every element and every other force\u000aeven including that particular element the Magus desires later to work with, has to be powerfully\u000abanished from the Circle. But the banishing over, and a pure and clear area obtained within the confines\u000aof the circle or Temple, then the element Air, for example, may be invoked with safety. For with a sure\u000aknowledge the Magus has made thoroughly certain that no other elements are present to adulterate it or\u000arender it mixed and impure.\u000a5. Hence, from the natural principles inherent within the human constitution, Hermes demands\u000athe removal of all imperfections. The vapour from the water refers to the libido-residues developed\u000afrom unrestrained infantile fantasy - impure thought-forms would be the appropriate occult cliché. And\u000awhen this is accomplished, and the emotions and their vehicle are purified, then indeed we have \u201cthe\u000asovereign philosophy and secret of all hidden things\u201d.\u000aThat some investigators have confounded the high art with metallurgical operations seems not very\u000adifficult to understand. The first verse of the seventh section would assuredly give some degree of\u000aauthority and confirmation to their efforts. Yet the key is there. The terms need but simple translation.\u000aThe seven bodies or metals are referrable to the seven astrological planets and these again to the\u000aconstituents of man\u2019s own nature.\u000aSaturn - lead - libido; synthetic symbol of (crude) unformulated spiritual nature.\u000aJupiter - tin - consciousness; memory in particular.\u000aMars - iron - will.\u000aVenus - copper - Emotion, passion and feeling.\u000aMercury - Quicksilver - nervous force, prana, vital magnetism.\u000aLuna - silver - the astral; the quick ever-changing substance which is the vehicle of consciousness,\u000aplastic to every passing thought.\u000aSol - gold - Soul; the redeemed and regenerated ego.\u000aWhen purified by art, and illuminated by the processes of Alchemy, indeed consciousness may\u000atransmute all the other metals, or principles, in man. Transforming them, it enables them to perform\u000atheir perfect and proper function in the psychic economy without hindrance, and without interference\u000afrom any other-uniting them all into a single whole.\u000a2. The ferment, here described, is none other than the vital spirit, libido. It alone, when assisted in\u000aits ascent from the darkling depths of the underworld, can so affect the different parts of the psyche as\u000ato act after the nature of a ferment-and to transform them. Unity of the individuality is indispensable to\u000athe commencement of the transforming action - otherwise we have not fermentation, but disintegration\u000aand chaos.\u000a5. The result of integration may at first be bewildering in so far as life then presents itself in a\u000atotally different guise to the unsuspecting sight of the experimentalist. He has finished with the old\u000aneurotic point of view, but has entered a world where he is not yet certain of himself. It is a temporary\u000astate of doubt and perplexity. That is, it is not sweet. But it is only a temporary stopping place, soon\u000ayielding when familiarity accustoms vision to that which is strange, to a more settled and therefore\u000ahappier and more balanced outlook.\u000a\u000aPage 33\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aBOOK TWO\u000aCHAPTER FIVE\u000aTHE MAGNETIC THEORY\u000aTHERE is but little question that the application of the psychological method, though it does explain\u000amuch, does not fully cover the ground in alchemy in a way that is particularly satisfying to the critical\u000asense. Possibly, we should be content in that it affords us some degree of empirical understanding and\u000ainsight into obscure modes of thought. We are given a certain degree of perception into what are\u000aotherwise objectionable forms of obscurantism and secrecy. It seems offensive to our particular modern\u000atype of consciousness that men, otherwise of good character, sound intellectual judgment and capacity,\u000ashould in the past have expressed no small degree of sympathy with this subject. Their sympathy and\u000aenthusiasm receives therefore some approbation and justification when interpreting their mystifications\u000ain this particular light.\u000aAnalytical Psychology and its fellow, Psycho-analysis, are quite recent appearances on the\u000athreshold of intellectual accomplishment. In mediaeval times we find but little evidence of the\u000apsychological method. Of philosophies there have been dozens. Former epochs abounded with mystical\u000asystems of interior prayer and meditation, and Magic too was well represented. It is in the past, in my\u000aestimation. and in ancient systems, that we must look for another and possibly more enlightening clue to\u000athe hermetic mystery. In fact, one author, Mrs. M. Atwood, who has given us what indubitably must be\u000aadmitted to be the best volume on alchemical hermeneutics, does posit the theory that Mesmerism or\u000aMagnetism gives the key - though no more - to this mystery. In view of this hypothesis, therefore, it may\u000abe wise if I summarily consider the historical ground and antecedents of vital Magnetism in order that\u000athe reader may be acquainted with the outlines of what later will be elaborated.\u000aFrom a study of Greek and Latin literature it is almost certain that a species of healing by a laying\u000aon of hands was so commonly practised in ancient days as not to demand a detailed or particularized\u000adescription. Underlying such a method was the belief that the human organism generates or is\u000apermeated by an electric or creative power or fluid, animal magnetism or vital emanation. Not only does\u000ait circulate in its own arterial system but, aided by a laying on of hands and directed by a keen\u000aimagination and strong will, it can be communicated to another person for therapeutic purposes. It need\u000ahardly be laboured that the Bible contains many references to cures of an apparently magnetic nature.\u000aAnd such magnetic methods continued from the earliest times through to the Middle Ages. They were\u000acommonplace in Europe for centuries.\u000aAvicenna, a physician of the ninth or tenth century, said \u201cThe imagination of man can act not only\u000aon his own body, but even on others and very distant bodies. It can fascinate and modify them; make\u000athem ill, or restore them to health.\u201d Marcus Fienus, a physician of Florence, said in the same century:\u000a\u201cA vapour, or a certain spirit, emitted by the rays of the eyes, or in any other manner, can take effect on\u000aa person near you. It is not to be wondered at that diseases of the mind and of the body should be\u000acommunicated or cured in that manner.\u201d\u000aPetrus Pomponatius of Mantua believed that: \u201cSome men are specially endowed with eminently\u000acurative faculties; the effects produced by their touch are wonderful; but even touch is not always\u000anecessary; their glances, their mere intention of doing good, are efficient to the restoration of health.\u201d\u000aHere we have an adumbration, at least, of hypnotic practise and the suggestion theory.\u000aVan Helmont, the sixteenth-century discoverer of laudanum, ammonia, volatile salts, etc., also held\u000aopinions similar to Mesmer. He held that: \u201cMagnetism is a universal agent; there is nothing new in it\u000abut the name. Magnetism is that occult influence which bodies exert over each other at a distance by\u000ameans of attraction and repulsion.\u201d He named this influence the \u201cMagnale Magnum\u201d, as Eliphas Levi\u000amuch later on, in the nineteenth century, spoke of it as the Astral Light. Helmont conceived of it, not as\u000aa corporeal thing, but as an ethereal, pure, vital spirit or essence. It penetrates all bodies, and in man has\u000aits seat in the blood., where it exists as a peculiar energy, enabling him by the force of will and\u000aimagination to act at a distance. He also asserted the idea of polarity or the duality of magnetism, which\u000ahe claims is composed of a vital principle and a \u201cwill principle\u201d. The former exists \u201cin the flesh and\u000ablood of man\u201d, the latter belongs to the soul, or consciousness. But since soul and body are not separate\u000a\u000aPage 34\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000adiscrete entities but together comprise a whole, so magnetism is one, manifesting in different principles\u000aon different planes. It seems to accord fairly well with the psychological definitions of libido.\u000aSendivogius, the great alchemist, wrote: \u201cLet therefore the searcher of this sacred science know that\u000athe soul in man, the lesser world or microcosm, substituting the place of its centre, is the king, and is\u000aplaced in the vital spirit in the purest blood. That governs the mind, and the mind the body.\u201d It is upon\u000athis statement, and the philosophy underlying such a postulate, that is built up the hypothesis of vital\u000amagnetism as the key opening to the threshold of the alchemical mystery.\u000aWilliam Maxwell, a contemporary of Van Helmont, held similar views, some of which are\u000acuriously like those of emanations or radiations from the body, countenanced openly in several modern\u000ascientific quarters. He remarks: \u201cAll bodies emit corporeal rays serving as vehicles through which the\u000asoul transmits her influence, by communicating to them her energy and power of acting; and these rays\u000aare not only corporeal, but they are even composed of various kinds of matter. The universal remedy is\u000ano other than the vital spirit strengthened in a suitable subject.\u201d\u000aSebastian Wirdig, a learned philosopher-physician of the same generation, averred: \u201cThe whole\u000aworld exists through magnetism; all sublunary vicissitudes occur through magnetism; life is preserved\u000aby magnetism; everything functions by magnetism.\u201d\u000aSimilar passages are to be found in the works of Paracelsus and a host of leading authors of these\u000aand later centuries. All more or less affirm the existence of a universal ether, the medium both of light\u000aand thought activity. That ether they represented interiorly in man by a vital spirit or magnetism which\u000aradiated and emanated a vital influence from him, subtly and invisibly. This spiritual force, so the\u000atheory went, could be controlled and manipulated for purposes of healing by a willed transmission\u000athrough the hands, or by direct glance of the eye, to another ailing individual. But it is only when we\u000acome to Mesmer and his disciples and colleagues that we realize the superiority of his theoretical\u000aformulation of the concept of magnetism and the advantages of his particular approach.\u000aFranz Anton Mesmer was born in Austria in I734, and in 1766 in Vienna he became an M.D. His\u000ainaugural address maintained that the sun, moon, and stars affect each other and cause tides, not only in\u000athe ocean and sea, but in the atmosphere too. It was his theory that they affect in a similar way all\u000aorganized bodies, through the medium of a subtle and mobile fluid which he conceived to pervade and\u000apermeate the universe, and to associate all things together in material intercourse and harmony. His\u000atheory further included the idea that all things soever in Nature possess a peculiar power which\u000amanifests itself by special action upon other bodies. That is to say, it is a physical and dynamic power\u000aacting exteriorly, without any chemical union, or without being introduced physically into the interior of\u000athe organization. Mesmer also contemplated the idea that all organic bodies, animals, plants, trees,\u000awaters, metals,, might be magnetized. By this he meant that they could be charged or impregnated with\u000aa flow or current of vital energy. This cosmic vitality or animal magnetism could be transmitted, he\u000aclaimed, by direct contact with a body already magnetized, or by means of the hand, the look, or even\u000athe will. Like light and electricity it could penetrate solid and fluid bodies, and, so he thought, could be\u000areflected by mirrors or polished surfaces, especially in the direction of its poles.\u000aSo far as the practical application of general theory is concerned, Mesmer, like modern\u000apsychological exponents,, believed that moral causes and erroneous attitudes towards life may\u000aconstitute the underlying factors in disease. That is to say an attitude towards life which was in conflict\u000aor at variance with reality could interfere with the psychic distribution of vitality throughout the bodily\u000asystem. Such a general equilibrium could produce vastly improved health in functional and organic\u000adisease. His theory held that the magnetism is continually circulating in the bodily system. Not only so\u000abut that it emanates to an appreciable distance about the body. When the rapport is made between\u000apatient and healer, that is when contact is established either by glance or mesmeric passes or physical\u000atouch, it circulates through the systems of the two people, just as blood would if their arteries and veins\u000awere interconnected - assuming that such a condition were possible.\u000aThe reception of his theories and then startling cures was not particularly happy. Commissions\u000awere authorized to examine the cures announced by Mesmer and his patients, and following\u000aunfavourable reports and much antagonism he fell foul of public opinion almost everywhere. In passing,\u000ait may be well to mention that somehow or other in the early part of his career he had received some\u000asuggestive ideas from two Jesuits named Gassner and Hehl. The former used exorcism as a means of\u000acuring certain types of disease. He held a theory, modified from the straightforward Roman Catholic\u000aview, that there are two kinds of disease. The one is curable by the ordinary means employed by\u000adoctors, whilst the other can only be cured by priestly means, by exorcism. To these he added a third\u000acategory which he called \u201cmixed\u201d, requiring the services both of priest and doctor. Gassner also\u000aimparted the secret of strengthening the curative effect by moving one\u2019s hands over the diseased parts\u000aof the body. Later such movements became known as \u201cpasses\u201d. From Hehl, Mesmer had obtained at the\u000a\u000aPage 35\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aoutset of his public career a set of magnetized steel plates which, when laid upon different parts of the\u000abody, were claimed to have a curative effect. Mesmer did not long persist in the use of these plates,\u000apassing on to the use of his baquet, and much later on discarding all these accessories, coming to rely\u000aexclusively on the magnetism generated by or emanating from his own personality. He pictured man as\u000aa closed circuit of the magnetic fluid; also as taking part in a larger cosmic circuit, or in many larger\u000acircuits of magnetism or energy which flowed through him from the universe about him, thus renewing\u000athe vitality of his personality. We find Mesmer constantly speaking both of increasing the rapidity of the\u000aflow of magnetism through the body and of equilibriating that vital flow. He does not care to speak of\u000a\u201ccharging\u201d the patient with magnetism or of \u201csaturating\u201d him with the fluid. His theory consisted solely\u000ain the idea of equilibriating the disturbed vitality in the body of his patient.\u000aFollowing Mesmer, we come to the Abbé Faria, a French priest who, after experimenting some\u000atime with mesmerism, announced in I8I4 a view of the subject comparable to that held at this day. That\u000ais to say, he did not stress any actual communication or even equilibriation of magnetism from healer to\u000apatient as being the primary factor in therapy. He held the view that the effects were mainly subjective.\u000aThe mesmeric state was possibly due to changes in the mind and body of the subject produced by faith\u000aand expectancy. In other words it was an anticipation on general lines of the later theory that the\u000ahypnotic or mesmeric state was induced solely by expectancy and by suggestion. At the time, however,\u000athis view was glossed over and forgotten.\u000aAlthough at the date of Mesmer's death in I8I5 his system of procedure of inducing a violent crisis\u000ain the patient was followed in its integrity by a considerable number of practitioners almost everywhere,\u000amore especially in Germany, there were already two other more or less important schools of Animal\u000aMagnetism in existence. One of these was the school of de Barbarin, who taught that the cures were\u000aeffected directly through the providence of God, being in reality the result of faith alone. The processes\u000aof Mesmer, he held, served but to disguise that fact, and in no way to assist the cure which was in every\u000ainstance produced by an \u201cact of the soul\u201d. Having no new processes to describe, and no new worthwhile theory to enunciate, this school has left very little record of its existence.\u000aThe development of Magnetism in the so-called \u201cExperimental\u201d school of the operators who were\u000aundoubtedly the legitimate heirs and successors of Mesmer, caused the disappearance of the schools\u000aboth of Mesmer proper and of de Barbarin. But who were the \u201cgreat magnetizers\u201d of this experimental\u000aschool? These included a great many operators in almost every country in Europe. Many were\u000aphysicians who, during the last quarter of the eighteenth century and the first quarter of the nineteenth,\u000adevoted themselves to magnetic therapy. Some established private institutions where patients were\u000areceived, whilst others operated in various hospitals. The best known of that generation of magnetizers\u000aare the Marquis de Puységur, Baron du Potet, Deleuze, and Lafontaine, all of whom have left treatises\u000aon the subject. Very soon, de Puységur, as a pioneer, began to move away from his master both in the\u000atheory and practise of Magnetism. Indeed we may safely say that the later magnetizers followed the\u000apupil rather than the master. Were we to call the processes of Mesmer and the violent effects in the\u000aartificial crisis which he encouraged as \u201cMesmerism\u201d then the real discoverer of Animal Magnetism, as\u000ait has been known for the last hundred years, as a phenomenon rather than as a theory, is the Marquis de\u000aPuységur, the acknowledged founder of the \u201cExperimental\u201d school. It is to him that are due the\u000aprocesses now generally known as mesmeric - processes which are productive of results differing\u000aconsiderably from those produced by Mesmer himself. De Puységur\u2019s early instructions for magnetizing\u000aare as follows: \u201cYou are to consider yourself as a magnet; your arms and particularly your hands being\u000aits poles; and when you touch a patient by laying one of your hands on his back, and the other in direct\u000aopposition upon his stomach, you are to imagine that the magnetic fluid has a tendency to circulate from\u000aone hand to the other through the body of the patient. You may vary this position by placing one hand\u000aon the head and the other on the stomach, still with the same intention, the same desire of doing good.\u000aThe circulation from one hand to the other will continue, the head and stomach being the parts of the\u000abody where the greatest number of nerves converge; these are, therefore, the two centres to which your\u000aaction ought to be mostly directed. Friction is quite unnecessary ; it is sufficient to touch with great\u000aintention.\u201d\u000aThere was a fundamental difference between the theories of Mesmer and de Puységer. The former\u000aemphatically asserted that magnetism was an ocean of life and vitality permeating all things, and\u000apervading the earth and the air as well as the human system. His conception of his cure by the magnetic\u000atechnique was simply the adjustment of the disturbed flow of magnetic or etheric currents within the\u000asystem of his patients. De Puységur, on the other hand, held the idea that the operator definitely imparts\u000amagnetism or vitality to the patient, and that such an imparting of power is responsible for the\u000arestoration of health. It is significant that neither Mesmer nor the adherents of his school ever\u000acomplained of fatigue or exhaustion after treatments, whilst, on the other hand, it was no common thing\u000a\u000aPage 36\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000afor the practitioners of the experimental school to experience exhaustion after a certain number of\u000atreatments. The modem magical conception really combines both theories. Not only does it postulate as\u000aa categorical fact the existence of cosmic ethers or flows of vitality and spiritual power, but it carries the\u000apostulate a step further. These cosmic streams of force, pervading and permeating all space and all\u000athings therein, must of necessity permeate the physical and astral form of man. Thus within him are\u000amirrored the forces of the cosmos he is a miniature epitome of the macrocosm. By the employment of\u000ahis volitional and imaginative faculties, the intelligent man is able to direct these currents through his\u000aown physique, willing their entrance into the system of another for therapeutic or other purposes. It is\u000aonly man's egotism and self-willed complacency that shuts off the free flow of the spirit. The libido\u000aflows up freely from the Unconscious when there are no resistances, the individual Unconscious\u000areceiving its power and its very existence from the Collective Unconscious - that which is common to\u000aall men and the whole of life.\u000aDe Puységur\u2019s first discovery of any importance was that in the drowsy or somnambulistic state\u000awhich quite early is produced by the application of magnetism, it was possible to address the patient\u000aand obtain evidence of a very high order of intelligence. Mesmer was previously aware of the induction\u000aof somnambulism but rarely interfered with it, considering it as a natural state by means of which the\u000asystem adjusted its inequilibrium. Dr. William Gregory, many years later, in describing the\u000asomnambulistic patient declares that his whole manner seems to undergo an improvement and\u000arefinement. \u201cIt would seem as if the brute or animal propensities were laid to rest, while the intellect\u000aand higher sentiments shone forth.\u201d What interested de Puységur most about this new discovery was\u000athat not only did the replies he received from sleeping patients show the most marvellous insight their\u000aown symptoms and the means of treating them, but they gave evidence of the extraordinary\u000aphenomenon of telepathy. Here was the beginning of what came to be known as the \u201chigher\u000aphenomena\u201d.\u000aHis second discovery was made in 1811. It consisted in finding out how to produce the\u000asomnambulistic state more quickly and more efficiently than before, namely by the use of passes.\u000aSeveral years later, du Potet laid more stress on the effect of the will and less on benevolent intentions,\u000arelying far more even than did de Puységur on the fixation of the eye and the passes. Lafontaine, who\u000ahas been called the last of the great magnetizers, relied almost exclusively on the passes, except that\u000asometimes he established contact with the hands while looking into the eyes of his subjects. Of course.\u000ahis will was exerted powerfully all the time.\u000aChiefly responsible for introducing Mesmerism into England was Dr. John Elliotson, who\u000aemployed it surgically at University College Hospital, London. No sooner had Elliotson demonstrated\u000aits efficiency - and he did that in a most remarkable way- than his medical colleagues commenced to\u000aderide and ridicule both himand his practice. The term hypnotism as a less objectionable and more\u000ascientific term for certain aspects of the mesmeric state was first coined in i843 by a Manchester\u000aphysician. Dr. James Braid. It was in 1842 that he first began experimental work with mesmerism, and\u000aseems to have been the first modern practitioner deliberately to use the technique of fixation of sight\u000aand suggestion instead of passes and the laying on of hands. Even the bright object was after a while\u000aeliminated since in some patients it aggravated conjunctivitis, the entire stress being now laid upon\u000averbal suggestion.\u000aAnother eminent pioneer was James Esdaile, a Scottish medico stationed in India. He appears to\u000ahave been the first British mesmerist to receive some measure of official support. From I845 onwards\u000ahe employed mesmeric states for painless surgery with great success at various Indian hospitals, and the\u000arecord of his operations by these means make thrilling reading. Many of his operations were for the\u000aremoval of monstrous scrotal tumours weighing nearly a hundredweight, horrible but deadly convincing\u000aevidence of the effectiveness of his technique. The discovery and wide application of ether and\u000achloroform for painless surgery put an end to the interest in hypnotic experimental work. From 1842 to\u000amore or less the end of the century there is a break in the history of hypnotism in England. On the\u000aContinent, however, we come across famous names like Liébault, Bernheim, Moll, Chaxcot, Janet, and\u000athe beginning of different groups of hypnotic operators coming to hold vastly different theories - the\u000aNancy School, the Saltpétrière School, etc. Doctors Lloyd Tuckey, Morton Prince, Vincent Wingfield,\u000aMilne Bramwell, and Bernard Hollander, are other names of English experimentalists who have done\u000amuch to restore public confidence and scientific respectability to the subject more recently.\u000aManifestly this is no more than a superficial glance at the subject. It is only in an indirect way that\u000awe are here concerned with animal magnetism as a therapeutic agent. My reasons for this outline are\u000athat Mrs. Atwood, whose theory I am to delineate and expand, held that the practice of Mesmerism\u000amight be considered as the first step to the solution of the alchemic mystery. That she had vast insight\u000aand understanding is a statement which cannot be doubted. Before she was yet thirty this astonishing\u000a\u000aPage 37\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000ayoung woman wrote, at her father's instance, a small work entitled Early Magnetism, in its higher\u000arelations to Humanity as veiled in the Poets and the Prophets. Written in 1846 when most other\u000amesmerists and hypnotists were engaged solely in therapeutic work or in the application of the trance\u000astate to the production of psychic phenomena such as clairvoyance and telepathy, etc., this woman and\u000aher father., Mr. South, were displaying an acumen and insight which are literally amazing. They\u000arealized other and more spiritual possibilities concealed within the practice of animal magnetism. In this\u000awork she expressed the view that in its application to higher ideals, one object of the magnetic trance\u000amight be to conjoin the mind to its lost spiritual universality. She believed it might be possible to pass\u000athe consciousness regressively through its many phases of historical evolutionary development back to\u000athe long-forgotten life in Reality, \u201cpassing behind the murky media of sense and fantasy to behold\u000areflected in the brightened mirror of our own intelligence the pure Truth; not as it may appear\u000aindividually or arbitrarily but in its characteristic necessity and universality\u201d.\u000aFurthermore, in describing the technique to be pursued, she adds:\u000aThe trance state when justly and perseveringly ordered for that end, affords the metaphysical\u000acondition pre-eminently perfect; for it removes the sensible obstruction and presents a clearer glass\u000abefore the mind than it can ever regard in the natural state. The patient is no sooner lightly\u000aentranced than he begins to feel an internality never before known to him and which may be\u000aintensified as the intention is fixed and the calibre of the mind and circumstantial conditions are\u000afavourable; the passive personality collapses from its circumferential and phenomenal life into that\u000acentral Omnipresence whose circumference is not; whilst the mind, rightly disciplined and related\u000ato the Universal becomes universalized and one with the great magnetic Will of Nature, revolving\u000awith the Infinite Medium (the pure ether) through all its spheres, perceiving all things in all and in\u000aitself, until at length becoming, perfectly converted to its principle, the divinized microcosmic\u000aepitome moves with demiurgic power and grace.\u000aHere we have a mystical and religious conception which so far transcends the previous practice of\u000amagnetism as, for example, the Jungian concept of psychotherapy transcends the cruder and pioneer\u000atheories of the Freudian school. For whatever may or may not have been the underlying ground of belief\u000aand procedure in the alchemical writings, at any rate Mrs. Atwood\u2019s hypothesis is so suggestive and farreaching in its practical implications that one hesitates considerably to discard it without having\u000asubjected it thoroughly to a critical test.\u000aAlthough the alchemists were firm and adamant in their instruction that nothing could be\u000aaccomplished without the preliminary dissolution, they have left but little clue as to the significance of\u000athis operation. It is true that they have spoken of manual operations, but it seems that this could lend\u000acountenance not only to the mesmeric passes but also to the physical and metallurgical theory where\u000atransmutation was accomplished or attempted by hard labour and by sweat of the brow. The first way of\u000aapproach and the closed entrance to these manual operations remained a mystery, and its secret if we\u000aexcept this thesis had not yet been unfolded. Nor, if we may accept the admonition contained in their\u000aown writings, would it be possible to discover the method from a cursory examination of their books\u000aalone. Yet the process itself, as a technical method always must be, is said to have been in itself a very\u000asimple one. For it is called by some of them a play of children and is represented as very trivial, slight,\u000aalmost a ridiculous thing.\u000aRecent observation, or rather experience, during the last one hundred years or so, has elicited\u000avarious means of discovering this secret. The enormous progress which has been made in the translation\u000aof obscure Eastern texts dealing with the art of meditation, concentration, and religious exaltation, give\u000aus several clues. In fact, one modem alchernical apologist claims that the secret lies in a species of\u000ameditation and introversion leading to a self-induced trance state in which consciousness as such is not\u000aobscured, as for example it is in certain spiritualistic trance states. On the contrary, it is claimed that\u000aconsciousness becomes heightened and exalted by these methods, and all the faculties of mind are\u000asharpened and left in a much stronger condition than before. Not only so, but that the ego is much-more\u000aable to deal with life and living than ever it was prior to having undertaken this particular type of\u000apsychic training.\u000aThe psychological method, which previously we examined, is also another and very effective\u000amethod. Its popularity and the increasing interest in its technique is proof of the hold which it has taken\u000ain the popular mind not only as a means of therapy but as a philosophical mode of self-discovery and\u000aknowledge.\u000aBut the trance state as induced by magnetism and the reactions induced in the subject are so\u000asuggestive over and above these other symptoms that we are tempted to wonder whether here is not\u000a\u000aPage 38\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000asome technical method which answers to the enigmatical descriptions left to us by the ancients. We\u000aknow full well that some magnetic method of entrancement was widely practised in Greece. Thousands\u000aof years ago the Phrygian Dactyli, the initiated priests, spoken of as the magicians and exorcists of\u000asickness, healed disease by these processes. These methods were the principal agents in theurgic\u000amysteries as also in the Aesculapiea - the healing Temples of Aesculapius, where the patients were\u000atreated during the process of \u201cincubation\u201d, as it was termed, magnetically in sleep.\u000aCertain of Mr. Arthur Edward Waite\u2019s criticisms to the Atwood theory in his work The Secret\u000aTradition in .Alchemy demand some attention here. It would be difficult to find anywhere such\u000aunnecessary controversial criticism as is found in Mr. Waite\u2019s book. For one thing he accuses her of\u000aemploying a turgid, difficult style. This is certainly true. But the psychological mechanism of projection\u000amust operate here, for Mr. Waite\u2019s style is hardly beyond criticism in these very respects. However, it is\u000anot to the literary aspect of his criticisms that attention need be called at length. He remarks towards the\u000aend of his book that\u000ait is of common knowledge that the psychic state of many entranced subjects conveyed an\u000aimpression of purity, refinement, beauty, as if the actual or comparative grosser part has been put to\u000asleep for the time being. But this state is as far removed from the spiritual attainment envisaged by\u000aPlatonic successors as are the records of trance mediumship from the realizations of Eckhart and\u000aRuysbroeck, speaking in the light of the union.\u000aWhy Mr. Waite should utter this criticism against the Atwood hypothesis, it is hard to realize. It is\u000aparticularly out of place, for the point he raises is precisely the argument of Mrs. Atwood. She argues\u000athat if we compare the first effects of mesmerism, that is the somnambulistic state in which the so-called\u000ahigher phenomena of community of sense and feeling manifest, with the sacred art of the ancients, the\u000aformer appears but trivial. The supreme spiritual wisdom attained in divine union, the self-knowledge\u000athe ancients desired and the perfection of life and immortality their system promised and said to have\u000abeen bestowed on those initiated into the higher mysteries, these are objects quite outside of the vision\u000aof the mesmerists. What has Mesmerism to do with spiritual ends such as these? What is its philosophy,\u000ashe asked? Has it yet attempted to investigate consciousness and its deeps and origins? Naturally, the\u000aordinary mesmeric state bore no resemblance to the sublime mystic state of the great saints and\u000aphilosophers. And it is her hypothesis that this was realized by and known to the alchemists who\u000aemployed magnetism only as the first step towards the consummation of the divine mystery. It was by\u000athis means that the hermetic solution was accomplished. From this the other steps could be perceived\u000aand climbed. To effect this solution was only the beginning of the Hermetic art.\u000aThe medium (that is the astro-mental sheath) in its natural state is volatile, immanifest,\u000afantastic, irrational and impotent, compared with what it subsequently is able and by artificial\u000aconception suffers itself to become. The Alchemists, we repeat therefore, did not remain satisfied\u000awith a few passes of the hand or any first phenomena whatever, but they proceeded at once\u000ascientifically to purify, depriving the ether of its wild affections and impressures by a dissolution of\u000athe circulating body in its own blood. For this is the brazen Wall celebrated by Antiquity. Take the\u000aoccult Nature, which is our Brass, says Albertus, and wash it that it may be pure and clean.\u000aThus it is seen that the strictures of Mr. Waite are wholly without foundation. And I confess to a\u000asense of sad disappointment in him. The Atwood theory of mesmerism as applied to the Hermetic\u000amystery is, in my opinion, so important and so suggestive that it may be well to quote from her work at\u000agreater length in order to clarify exactly what it is that she proposes. When commenting upon The Six\u000aKeys Eudoxus I shall attempt to dilate upon this theory, simplifying her terminology and employing the\u000acomparative method.\u000aFirst of all it was her belief that there was a secret connected with the Mystery celebrations of the\u000aancients which no modern so-called intellectual criticism has explained away or divulged.\u000aA few writers on Animal Magnetism [she notes], having within these few years become\u000aenlightened by that singular discovery, suggest their Trance and its phenomena as a revelation of\u000athe Temple Mysteries and various religious rites. But no one, that we are aware, has developed this\u000asuggestion or carried the idea sufficiently above the therapeutic sphere; they appear to have taken a\u000abroad view, without particular inquiry into the nature of the rites from the ancients themselves. Had\u000athey done this (we speak of the more advanced minds) we are persuaded that with that key in hand,\u000atheir attention would have been drawn in new directions and their satisfaction about the modern use\u000a\u000aPage 39\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aof it become much modified by observing the far superior results which through their Theurgic\u000adisciplines, the ancients aspired after, different too, as they were superior to any that we are\u000aaccustomed to imagine even at the present day.\u000aThe ordinary effects of Animal Magnetism, or Mesmerism, or vital Magnetism, or by\u000awhatever other term the unknown agency is better expressed, are now so familiarly known in\u000apractice that it will be unnecessary to describe them; they have attracted the attention of the best\u000aand leading minds of the present age, who have hailed with admiration a discovery which enables\u000aman to alleviate pain and maladies insurmountable by other means . . . . But years have passed and\u000athe science has not grown, but retrograded rather in interest and power, since de Mainaduc,\u000aPuységer, Colquhoun, Elliotson, Townsend, Dupotet, and the rest, faithful spirits, first set their\u000afellow men on the road of inquiry.\u000aHer position and her attitude to the history and theory of Magnetism is thus made crystal clear; no\u000apossibility exists for misunderstanding. The hypothesis which she came to adopt did not stop with the\u000aacceptance of the psychical phenomena produced by the practice of the mesmeric art. A pioneer in an\u000aintellectual world, and a woman with a clearer spiritual vision and foresight than most of her day, she\u000arealized the intrinsically invaluable nature of the technique. She perceived that the experimental work of\u000atherapy and investigation of the higher phenomena was interesting and intriguing no doubt, but clearly it\u000awas not the sort of investigation that the ancients followed in their mysteries. It is true that they worked\u000aon the same kind of material, with similar instruments, and with a similar technical method. Yet their\u000apractice was different, because it was conducted upon established philosophical principles and with a\u000atruly enlightened as well as benevolent aim. That Mesmerism affords entrance together with the\u000aimagination into another kind of consciousness was the contention she could not doubt.\u000aAnd more than this, in well-conditioned cases, we have proof of the intrinsical intelligence\u000aand power of the Free Spirit which can expatiate into the whole circumference of its sphere and\u000areveal hidden things, exhibiting a variety of gifts . . . . This Mesmerism, in respect of our Mystery\u000athen, may be regarded as a first key which, opening into the vestibule, affords a view within the\u000asense\u2019s prison, but of the labyrinth of life only.\u000aThese protracted quotations will provide some preliminary notion as to what manner this practice\u000aof Magnetism is conceived of in this hypothesis. It is obvious that Mrs. Atwood regards it solely as an\u000aelementary view of a diviner state of consciousness, as the entrance into the hermetic mystery, solely as\u000aa means of entry and nothing more. Beyond this first stage, other means are to be employed, other\u000atechniques - a utilization of the magnetic art to transcend itself into perfection. This idea will expand\u000aitself as we read and examine the text following, and I shall attempt to dilate upon the simpler aspects of\u000athe technique in a brief commentary.\u000a\u000aPage 40\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aCHAPTER SIX\u000aThe Six Keys of Eudoxus, opening into the most Secret Philosophy.*\u000aTHE FIRST KEY\u000a1. The First Key is that which opens the dark prisons in which the Sulphur is shut up: this is it\u000awhich knows how to extract the seed out of the body, and which forms the Stone of the philosophers by\u000athe conjunction of the spirit with the body - of sulphur with mercury.\u000a2. Hermes has manifestly demonstrated the operation of this First Key by these words: In the\u000acaverns of the metals there is hidden the Stone, which is venerable, bright in colour, a mind sublime,\u000aand an open sea.\u000a3. This Stone has a bright glittering: it contains a Spirit of a sublime original; it is the Sea of the\u000aWise, in which they angle for their mysterious Fish.\u000a4. But the operations of the three works have a great deal of analogy one to another, and the\u000aphilosophers do designedly speak in equivocal terms, to the end that those who have not the Lynx's eyes\u000amay pursue wrong, and be lost in this labyrinth, from whence it is very hard to get out. In effect, when\u000aone imagines that they speak of one work they often treat of another.\u000a5. Take heed therefore, not to be deceived here; for it is a truth, that in each work the Wise Artist\u000aought to dissolve the body with the spirit; he must cut off the Raven's head, whiten the Black and vivify\u000athe White; yet it is properly in the First operation that the Wise Artist cuts off the head of the Black\u000aDragon and of the Raven.\u000a6. Hence, Hermes says, What is born of the Crow is the beginning of this Art. Consider that it is\u000aby separation of the black, foul, and stinking fume of the Blackest Black that our astral, white, and\u000aresplendent Stone is formed, which contains in its veins the blood of the Pelican. It is at this First\u000aPurification of the Stone, and at this shining whiteness, that the work of the First Key is ended.\u000aTHE SECOND KEY\u000a1. The Second Key dissolves the compound of the Stone, and begins the separation of the\u000aElements in a philosophical manner: this separation of the elements is not made but by raising up the\u000asubtle and pure parts above the thick and terrestrial parts.\u000a2. He who knows how to sublime the Stone philosophically, justly deserves the name of a\u000aphilosopher, since he knows the Fire of the Wise, which is the only instrument which can work this\u000asublimation. No philosopher has ever openly revealed this Secret Fire, and this powerful agent, which\u000aworks all the wonders of the Art: he who shall not understand it, and not know how to distinguish it by\u000athe characters whereby it is described, ought to make a stand here, and pray to God to make it clear to\u000ahim; for the knowledge of this great Secret is rather a gift of Heaven, than a Light acquired by the\u000anatural force of reasoning; let him nevertheless, read the writings of the philosophers; let him meditate;\u000aand, above all, let him pray: there is no difficulty which may not in the end be made clear by Work,\u000aMeditation, and Prayer.\u000a3. Without the sublimation of the Stone, the conversion of the Elements and the extraction of the\u000aPrinciples is impossible; and this conversion which makes Water of Earth, Air of Water, and Fire of\u000aAir, is the only way whereby our Mercury can be prepared.\u000a4. Apply yourself then to know this Secret Fire, which dissolves the Stone naturally and without\u000aviolence, and makes it dissolve into Water in the great sea of the Wise, by the distillation which is made\u000aby the rays of the Sun and Moon.\u000a5. It is in this manner that the Stone, which, according to Hermes, is the vine of the Wise, becomes\u000atheir Wine, which, by the operations of Art, produces their rectified Water of Life, and their most sharp\u000aVinegar. The Elements of the Stone cannot be dissolved but by this Nature wholly Divine; nor can a\u000aperfect dissolution be made of it, but after a proportioned digestion and putrefaction, at which the\u000aoperation of the Second Key of the First Work is ended.\u000aTHE THIRD KEY\u000a*\u000a\u000aThis text I have reproduced from Mrs. Atwood\u2019s book. She has taken it from The Hermetical Triumph\u000aby A. T. Limojonde St. Didier. This latter was translated from French into English in 1723. Mrs.\u000aAtwood has altered some of the wording in certain respects. I have again introduced numbering of the\u000aversicles for convenience\u2019 sake.\u000a\u000aPage 41\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000a1. The Third Key comprehends of itself alone a longer train of operations than all the rest\u000atogether. The philosophers have spoken very little of it, seeing the Perfection of our Mercury depends\u000athereon; the sincerest even, as Artefius, Trevisan, Flammel, have passed in silence the Preparation of\u000aour Mercury, and there is hardly one found who has not feigned, instead of showing the longest and the\u000amost important of the operations of our Practice. With a design to lend you a hand in this part of the\u000away, which you have to go and where for want of Light it is impossible to know the true road, I will\u000aenlarge myself more than others have done on this Third Key; or at least I will follow in an order, that\u000awhich they have treated so confusedly, that without the inspiration of Heaven, or without the help of a\u000afaithful friend, one remains undoubtedly in this labyrinth., without being able to find a happy\u000adeliverance from thence.\u000a2. I am sure that you who are the true Sons of Science will receive a very great satisfaction in the\u000aexplaining of these hidden Mysteries. which regard the separation and the purification of the Principles\u000aof our Mercury, which is made by a perfect dissolution and glorification of the body, whence it had its\u000anativity, and by the intimate union of the soul with its body, of whom the Spirit is the only tie which\u000aworks this conjunction.\u000a3. This is the Intention. and the essential point of the Operations of this Key, which terminate at\u000athe generation of a new substance infinitely nobler than the First.\u000a4. After the Wise Artist has made a spring of living water come out of the stone, and has pressed\u000aout the vine of the philosophers, and has made their wine, he ought to take notice that in this\u000ahomogeneous substance, which appears under the form of Water, there are three different substances,\u000aand three natural principles of bodies - Salt, Sulphur and Mercury - which are the spirit, the soul, and\u000athe body; and though they appear pure and perfectly united together, there still wants much of their\u000abeing so; for when by distillation we draw the Water, which is the soul and the spirit, the Body remains\u000ain the bottom of the vessel, like a dead, black, and dreggy earth, which, nevertheless, is not to be\u000adespised; for in our subject there is nothing which is not good.\u000a5. The philosopher, John Pontanus, protests that the very superfluities of the Stone are converted\u000ainto a true essence, and that he who pretends to separate anything from our subject knows nothing of\u000aphilosophy; for, that all which is therein superfluous, unclean, dreggy - in fine, the whole compound, is\u000amade perfect by the action of our Fire.\u000a6. This advice opens the eyes of those, who, to make an exact purification of the Elements and of\u000athe Principles, persuade themselves that they must only take the subtile and cast away the heavy. But\u000aHermes says the power of it is not integral until it be turned into earth; neither ought the sons of science\u000ato be ignorant that the Fire and the Sulphur are hidden in the centre of the Earth, and that they must\u000awash it exactly with its spirit, to extract out of it the Fixed Salt, which is the Blood of our Stone. This is\u000athe essential Mystery of the operation, which is not accomplished till after a convenient digestion and a\u000aslow distillation.\u000a7. You know that nothing is more contrary than fire and water; but yet the Wise Artist must make\u000apeace between the enemies, who radically love each other vehemently. Cosmopolite told the manner\u000athereof in a few words: All things therefore being purged make Fire and Water to be Friends, which\u000athey will easily do in their earth, which had ascended with them. Be then attentive on this point; moisten\u000aoftentimes the earth with its water, and you will obtain what you seek. Must not the body be dissolved\u000aby the water, and the Earth be penetrated with its Humidity, to be made proper for generation?\u000aAccording to philosophers, the Spirit is Eve, the Body is Adam; they ought to be joined together for the\u000apropagation of their species. Hermes says the same in other terms: "For Water is the strongest Nature\u000awhich surmounts and excites the fixed Nature in the Body, that is, rejoices in it."\u000a8. In effect, these two substances, which are of the same nature but of different genders, ascend\u000ainsensibly together, leaving but a little fæces in the bottom of their vessel; so that the soul, spirit, and\u000abody, after an exact purification, appear at last inseparably united under a more noble and more perfect\u000aForm than it was before, and as different from its first liquid Form as the alcohol of Wine exactly\u000arectified and actuated with its salt is different from the substance of the wine from whence it has been\u000adrawn; this comparison is not only very fitting, but it furthermore gives the sons of science a precise\u000aknowledge of the operations of the Third Key.\u000a9. Our Water is a living Spring which comes out of the Stone by a natural miracle of our\u000aphilosophy. The first of all is the water which issueth out of this Stone. It is Hermes who has\u000apronounced this great Truth. He acknowledges, further, that this water is the foundation of our Art.\u000a10. The philosophers give it many names; for sometimes they call it wine, sometimes water of life,\u000asometimes vinegar, sometimes oil, according to the different degrees of Preparation, or according to the\u000adiverse effects which it is capable of producing.\u000a\u000aPage 42\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000a11. Yet I let you know that it is properly called the Vinegar of the Wise, and that in the distillation\u000aof this Divine Liquor there happens the same thing as in that of common vinegar; you may hence draw\u000ainstruction: the water and the phlegm ascend first; the oily substance, in which the efficacy of the water\u000aconsists, comes the last, etc.\u000a12. It is therefore necessary to dissolve the body entirely to extract all its humidity which contains\u000athe precious ferment, the sulphur, that balm of Nature, and wonderful unguent, without which you ought\u000anot to hope ever to see in your vessel this blackness so desired by all the philosophers. Reduce then the\u000awhole compound into water, and make a perfect union of the volatile with the fixed; it is a precept of\u000aSenior's, which deserves attention, that the highest fume should be reduced to the lowest; for the divine\u000awater is the thing descending from heaven, the reducer of the soul to its body, which it at length revives.\u000a13. The Balm of Life is hid in these unclean fæces you ought to wash them with this c\u0153lestial water\u000auntil you have removed away the blackness from them, and then your Water shall be animated with this\u000aFiery Essence, which works all the wonders of our Art.\u000a14. But., further, that you may not be deceived with the terms of the Compound, I will tell you that\u000athe philosophers have two sorts of compounds. The first is the compound of Nature, wherof I have\u000aspoken in the First Key; for it is Nature which makes it in a manner incomprehensible to the Artist, who\u000adoes nothing but lend a hand to Nature by the adhibition of external things, by the means of which she\u000abrings forth and produces this admirable compound.\u000a15. The second is the compound of Art; it is the Wise man who makes it by the secret union of the\u000afixed with the volatile, perfectly conjoined with all prudence, which cannot be acquired but by the lights\u000aof a profound philosophy.\u000a16. The compound of Art is not altogether the same in the Second as in the Third Work; yet it is\u000aalways the Artist who makes it. Geber defines it, a mixture of Argent vive and Sulphur, that is to say, of\u000athe volatile and the fixed; which, acting on one another, are volatilized and fixed reciprocally into a\u000aperfect Fixity. Consider the example of Nature; you see that the earth will never produce fruit if it be\u000anot penetrated with its humidity, and that the humidity would always remain barren if it were not\u000aretained and fixed by the dryness of the earth.\u000a17. So, in the Art, you can have no success if you do not in the first work purify the Serpent, born\u000aof the Slime of the earth; if you do not whiten these foul and black fæces, to separate from thence the\u000awhite sulphur. which is the Sal Amoniac of the Wise, and their Chaste Diana, who washes herself in the\u000abath; and all this mystery is but the extraction of the fixed salt of our compound, in which the whole\u000aenergy of our Mercury consists.\u000a18. The water which ascends by distillation carries up with it a part of this fiery salt, so that the\u000aaffusion of the water on the body, reiterated many times, impregnates, fattens, and fertilizes our\u000aMercury, and makes it fit to be fixed, which is the end of the second Work.\u000a19. One cannot better explain this Truth than by Hermes, in these words:\u000aWhen I saw that the water by degrees did become thicker and harder I did rejoice, for I certainly\u000aknew that I should find what I sought for.\u000aIt is not without reason that the philosophers give this viscous Liquor the name of Pontick Water.\u000aIts exuberant ponticity is indeed the true character of its virtue, and the more you shall rectify it, and the\u000amore you shall work upon it, the more virtue will it acquire. It has been called the Water of Life,\u000abecause it gives life to the metals; but it is properly called the great Lunaria, because of its brightness\u000awherewith it shines. . . .\u000a20. Since I speak only to you, ye true scholars of Hermes, I will reveal to you one secret which you\u000awill not find entirely in the books of the philosophers. Some of them say, that of their liquor they make\u000atwo Mercuries - the one White and the other Red; Flammel has said more particularly, that one must\u000amake use of the citrine Mercury to make the Imbibition to the Red; giving notice to the Sons of Art not\u000ato be deceived on this point, as he himself had been, unless the Jew had informed him of the truth.\u000a21. Others have taught that the White Mercury is the bath of the Moon, and that the Red Mercury is\u000athe bath of the Sun. But there are none who have been willing to show distinctly to the Sons of Science\u000aby what means they may get these two mercuries. If you apprehend me well, you have the point already\u000acleared up to you.\u000a22. The Lunaria is the White Mercury, the most sharp Vinegar is the Red Mercury; but the better to\u000adetermine these two mercuries, feed them with flesh of their own species - the blood of innocents whose\u000athroats are cut; that is to say, the spirits of the bodies are the Bath where the Sun and Moon go to wash\u000athemselves.\u000a\u000aPage 43\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000a23. I have unfolded to you a great mystery, if you reflect well on it; the philosophers who have\u000aspoken thereof have passed over this important point very slightly. Cosmopolite has very wittily\u000amentioned it by an ingenious allegory, speaking of the purification of the Mercury: This will be done,\u000asays he, if you shall give our old man gold and silver to swallow, that he may consume them, and at\u000alength he also dying may be burnt. He makes an end of describing the whole magistery in these terms:\u000aLet his ashes be strewed in the water; boil it until it is enough, and you have a medicine to cure the\u000aleprosy. You must not be ignorant that Our Old Man is our Mercury; this name indeed agrees with him\u000abecause He is the first matter of all metals. He is their water, as the same author goes on to say, and to\u000awhich he gives also the name of steel and of the lodestone; adding for a greater confirmation of what I\u000aam about to discover to you, that if gold couples with it eleven times it sends forth its seed, and is\u000adebilitated almost unto death; but the Chalybes conceives and begets a son more glorious than the\u000aFather.\u000a24. Behold a great Mystery which I reveal to you without an enigma; this is the secret of the two\u000amercuries which contain the two tinctures. Keep them separately, and do not confound their species, for\u000afear they should beget a monstrous Lineage.\u000a25. I not only speak to you more intelligibly than any philosopher before has done, but I also reveal\u000ato you the most essential point in the Practice; if you meditate thereon, and apply yourself to understand\u000ait well; but above all, if you work according to those lights which I give you, you may obtain what you\u000aseek for.\u000a26. And if you come not to these knowledges by the way which I have pointed out to you. I am very\u000awell assured that you will hardly arrive at your design by only reading the philosophers. Therefore\u000adespair of nothing - search the source of the Liquor of the Sages, which contains all that is necessary for\u000athe work; it is hidden under the Stone - strike upon it with the Red of Magic Fire, and a clear fountain\u000awill issue out; then do as 1 have shown you, prepare the bath of the King with the blood of the\u000aInnocents, and you will have the animated Mercury of the wise, which never loses its virtue, if you keep\u000ait in a vessel well closed.\u000a27. Hermes says, that there is so much sympathy between the purified bodies and the spirits, that\u000athey never quit one another when they are united together: because this union resembles that of the soul\u000awith the glorified body; after which Faith tells us, there shall be no more separation or death; because\u000athe spirits desire to be in the cleansed bodies, and having them, they enliven and dwell in them.\u000a28. By this you may observe the merit of this precious liquor, to which the philosophers have given\u000amore than a thousand different names, which is in sum the great Alcahest, which radically dissolves the\u000ametals - a true permanent water which, after having radically dissolved them, is inseparably united to\u000athem, increasing their weight and tincture.\u000aTHE FOURTH KEY\u000aThe Fourth Key of the Art is the entrance to the Second Work (and a reiteration in part and\u000adevelopment of the foregoing): it is this which reduces our Water into Earth; there is but this only\u000aWater in the world, which by a bare boiling can be converted into Earth, because the Mercury of the\u000aWise carries in its centre its own Sulphur, which coagulates it. The terrification of the Spirit is the only\u000aoperation of this work. Boil them with patience; if you have proceeded well, you will not be a long time\u000awithout perceiving the marks of this coagulation; and if they appear not in their time, they will never\u000aappear; because it is an undoubted sign that you have failed in some essential thing in the former\u000aoperations; for to corporify the Spirit, which is our Mercury, you must have well dissolved the body in\u000awhich the Sulphur which coagulates the Mercury is enclosed. But Hermes assumes that our mercurial\u000awater shall obtain all the virtues which the philosophers attribute to it if it be turned into earth. An earth\u000aadmirable is it for fertility - the Land of Promise of the Wise, who, knowing how to make the dew of\u000aHeaven fall upon it, cause it to produce fruits of an inestimable price. Cultivate then diligently this\u000aprecious earth, moisten it often with its own humidity, dry it as often, and you will no less augment its\u000avirtue than its weight and its fertility.\u000aTHE FIFTH KEY\u000aThe Fifth Key includes the Fermentation of the Stone with the perfect body, to make thereof the\u000amedicine of the Third order. I will say nothing in particular of the operation of the Third work; except\u000athat the Perfect Body is a necessary leaven of Our Paste. And that the Spirit ought to make the union of\u000athe paste with the leaven in the same manner as water moistens meal, and dissolves the leaven to\u000acompose a fermented paste fit to make bread. This comparison is very proper; Hermes first made it,\u000asaying, that as a paste cannot be fermented without a ferment; so when you shall have sublimed,\u000a\u000aPage 44\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000acleansed and separated the foulness from the Fæces, and would make the conjunction, put a ferment to\u000athem and make the water earth, that the paste may be made a ferment; which repeats the instruction of\u000athe whole work, and shows, that just so as the whole lump of the paste becomes leaven, by the action of\u000athe ferment which has been added, so all the philosophic confection becomes, by this operation, a\u000aleaven proper to ferment a new matter, and to multiply it to infinity. If you observe well how bread is\u000amade, you will find the proportions also, which you ought to keep among the matters which compose\u000aour philosophical paste. Do not the bakers put more meal than leaven, and more water than the leaven\u000aand the meal? The laws of Nature are the rules you ought to follow in the practice of our magistery. I\u000ahave given you, upon the principal point, all the instructions which are necessary for you, so that it\u000awould be superfluous to tell you more of it; particularly concerning the last operations, about which the\u000aAdepts have been less reserved than at the First, which are the foundations of the Art.\u000aTHE SIXTH KEY\u000aThe Sixth Key teaches the Multiplication of the Stone, by the reiteration of the same operation,\u000awhich consists but in opening and shutting, dissolving and coagulating, imbibing and drying; whereby\u000athe virtues of the Stone are, infinitely augmentable. As my design has been not to describe entirely the\u000aapplication of the three medicines, but only to instruct you in the important operations concerning the\u000apreparation of Mercury, which the philosophers commonly pass over in silence to hide the mysteries\u000afrom the profane which are only intended for the wise, I will tarry no longer upon this point, and will\u000atell you nothing more of what relates to the Projection of the Medicine, because the success you expect\u000adepends not thereon. I have not given you very full instructions except on the Third Key, because it\u000acontains a long train of operations which, though simple and natural, require a great understanding of\u000athe Laws of Nature, and of the qualities of Our Matter, as well as a perfect knowledge of chemistry and\u000aof the different degrees of heat which are fitting for these operations. I have conducted you by the\u000astraight way without any winding; and if you have well minded the road which I have pointed out to\u000ayou, I am sure that you will go straight to the end without straying. Take this in good part from me, in\u000athe design which I had of sparing you a thousand labours and a thousand troubles, which I myself have\u000aundergone in this painful journey for want of an assistance such as this is, which I give you from a\u000asincere heart and a tender affection for all the true sons of science. I should much bewail, if, like me,\u000aafter having known the true matter, you should spend fifteen years entirely in the work, in study and in\u000ameditation, without being able to extract out of the Stone the precious juice which it encloses in its\u000abosom, for want of knowing the secret fire of the wise, which makes to run out of this plant (dry and\u000awithered in appearance) a water which wets not the hands, and which by a magical union of the dry\u000awater of the sea of the wise, is dissolved into a viscous water - into a mercurial liquor, which is the\u000abeginning, the foundation., and the Key of our Art: Convert, separate, and purify the elements, as I have\u000ataught you, and you will possess the true Mercury of the philosophers, which will give you the fixed\u000aSulphur and the Universal Medicine. But I give you notice, moreover, that even after you shall be\u000aarrived at the knowledge of the Secret Fire of the Wise, yet still you shall not attain your point at your\u000afirst career. I have erred many years in the way which remain to be gone, to arrive at the mysterious\u000afountain where the King bathes himself, is made young again, and retakes a new life exempt from all\u000asorts of infirmities. Besides this you must know how to purify, to heal, and to animate the royal bath; it\u000ais to lend you a hand in this secret way that I have expatiated under the Third Key, where all those\u000aoperations are described. I wish with all my heart that the instructions which I have given you may\u000aenable you to go directly to the End. But remember, ye sons of philosophy, that the knowledge of our\u000aMagistery comes rather by the Inspiration of Heaven than from the Lights which we can get by\u000aourselves. This truth is acknowledged by all artists; it is for this reason that it is not enough to work;\u000apray daily, read good books, and meditate night and day on the operations of Nature, and on what she\u000amay be able to do when she is assisted by the help of our Art; and by these means you will succeed\u000awithout doubt in your undertaking. This is all I have now to say to you. I was not willing to make you\u000asuch a long discourse as the matter seemed to demand; neither have I told you anything but what is\u000aessential to our Art; so that if you know the Stone which is the only matter of Our Stone, and if you\u000ahave the Understanding of Our Fire, which is both secret and natural, you have the Keys of the Art, and\u000ayou can calcine Our Stone; not by the common calcination which is made by the violence of fire, but by\u000aa philosophic calcination which is purely natural. Yet observe this, with the most enlightened\u000aphilosophers, that there is this difference between the common calcination which is made by the force\u000aof Fire and the natural calcination; that the first destroys the body and consumes the greatest part of its\u000aradical humidity; but the second does not only preserve the humidity of the body in calcining it, but still\u000aconsiderably augments it. Experience will give you knowledge in the Practice of this great truth, for you\u000a\u000aPage 45\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000awill in effect find that this philosophical calcination, which sublimes and distils the Stone in calcining it,\u000amuch augments its humidity; the reason is that the igneous spirit of the natural fire is corporified in the\u000asubstances which are analogous to it. Our stone is an Astral Fire which sympathizes with the Natural\u000aFire, and which, as a true Salamander receives its nativity, is nourished and grows in the Elementary\u000aFire, which is geometrically proportioned to it.\u000a\u000aPage 46\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aCHAPTER SEVEN\u000aCOMMENTARY\u000aAt the outset the text informs us that the object of this first key is triple. That is, it opens up (a) the dark\u000aprisons in which the Sulphur or the Fire, that is the emotional life or vital magnetism or prana, is\u000aconfined. (b) The Seed is the philosophic Salt, the opposite of the Sulphur on the Qabalistic Tree, that\u000aSalt which, when purified, serves as the vehicular foundation of the enlightened mind, or the seed from\u000awhich the Aurific Stone is formed. (c) It forms the Stone by the conjunction of the Sulphur and\u000aMercury.\u000aClearly, the Stone represents the union of Mercury, which is Consciousness, and Sulphur, the fire\u000aof emotion, the anima principle of the psyche, using Salt as their basis of action, the astro-mental\u000asheath. The psychological interpretation in its theoretical aspect is still applicable here. As in the former\u000acommentary, the analytical method may be employed to induce the dissolution of consciousness in its\u000aown light; that is to say, by immersing its contents in that from which it originally issued, in the\u000aUnconscious. According to the magnetic theory, the approach to the first alchemical stage of dissolution\u000ais by means of the magnetic trance. Because of the transmission of great vitality from a skilled and\u000ainitiated operator, consciousness suffers an eclipse, enabling the secondary consciousness, or the divine\u000acore of the Unconscious, to hold unrestricted expression. Exactly what occurs to consciousness during\u000ahypnosis or mesmerism remains even to this day a moot point. Some hold one view, others another. In\u000aDr. Milne Bramwell's book on hypnotism, some hundred pages or so are taken up in a consideration of\u000athe various opinions as to the true state of consciousness. A footnote by Mrs. Atwood in her Suggestive\u000aInquiry into the Hermetic Mystery expresses the following opinion:\u000aWe adopt the term dissolve here in accordance with the old doctrine; varying theories have\u000abeen proposed to explain the change that takes place in the vital relationship of the patient in the\u000amesmeric trance; some have thought the sensible medium is drawn away by a superior attraction of\u000alife in the agent; others, that it is overcome, or included, or arrested, or destroyed; but the\u000aAlchemists, with one accord, say it ought to be dissolved; and, in default of better authority, shall\u000awe not suppose it so to be dissolved, or that it ought to be, the alkali by the acid, the dark dominion\u000aof the selfhood by the magnetic friction of its proper light, the sensible or animal into the vegetable,\u000athe cerebral into the ganglionic life? Corpora qui vult purgare oportet flux facere, says the author\u000aof the Rosarium, that the compact earthy body of sense may be rarefied and flow as a passive\u000awatery spirit. The beginning of the work, says Albertus Magnus, is a perfect solution; and all those\u000athat we teach is nothing else but to dissolve and recongeal the spirit, to make the fixed volatile and\u000athe volatile fixed until the total nature is perfected by the reiteration, both in its Solary and Lunar\u000aform.\u000a2. The compound of metals, or the aggregate of the astrological planets, with which the Sephiros\u000aof the Qabalistic Tree of Life and the metals are in correspondence, is the constitution of man. \u201cCavern\u201d\u000ain symbolism quite frequently stands for the darkness of the bodily life, the womb and the dark creative\u000ainterior of the Mother. Hence it is a generic universal symbol for the Unconscious itself, since it is from\u000athe vital dynamic urges and the inchoate mass of instincts that the conscious faculties gradually issue\u000aand evolve in the course of millions of years of evolution. The cave denotes an interior state or\u000acondition from which external things issue, or from which they are born - as in the case of the conscious\u000aintellectual life. In the Unconscious, then, are we to seek for the hidden Stone of the Wise. Our text\u000aaffirms the speculation that every state of consciousness has associated with it, or functions in, a vehicle\u000aof substance of some kind. The Stone clearly represents the brilliant self-shining aura, the luminous\u000aemanation from the inner Body of Light, glittering like some rare and precious jewel. In its proper sense\u000athe Stone is the term used to denote the unity of the Aura or astro-mental sheath, the vital magnetism or\u000apranic energy of the individuality, the vital spirit so-called, and the central core of consciousness itself.\u000aThe latter is concealed within the depths of man. Its antecedents go back to the very beginnings of\u000aevolution in the dim hazy epochs of primeval times; thus it is venerable and sublime in nature. Eudoxus\u000aidentifies it with the Collective Unconscious, the Sea of the Wise, using this term in its highest, widest,\u000aand all-inclusive sense as before implied. It is not only the psychic realm of the instincts, but also of the\u000aarchetypal world of the higher faculties of discrimination, intuition, and spiritual wisdom and\u000ainspiration. For the instincts are but the reflection of the higher spiritual parts of the divine nature.\u000a\u000aPage 47\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000a\u201cTheir mysterious Fish\u201d! What an intriguing expression! It has its correspondences in the\u000aspermatozoon swimming in the seminal sea; in the foetus bathed in the intra-uterine amniotic fluid. It\u000asymbolizes the possibility of life, points to the realm of the future and great promise, and belongs to that\u000aclass of eloquent symbols depicting rebirth and regeneration. In this connection there is an interesting\u000aillustration in The Book of Lambspring, one of the several books of the Hermetic Museum translated by\u000aWaite. It shows two fish swimming in a sea. Over the illustration we read \u201cBe warned and understand\u000atruly that two fishes are swimming in our Sea. The Sea is the body, the two fishes are Soul and Spirit\u201d.\u000aThe text accompanying the picture is as follows\u000aThe sages will tell you\u000aThat two fishes are in our sea\u000aWithout any flesh or bones.\u000aLet them be cooked in their own water;\u000aThen they also will become a vast sea,\u000aThe vastness of which no man can describe.\u000aMoreover, the Sages say\u000aThat the two fishes are one, not two;\u000aThey are two, and nevertheless they are one,\u000aBody, Spirit and Soul.\u000aNow I tell you most truly,\u000aCook these three together\u000aThat there may be a very large sea.\u000aCook the sulphur with the sulphur,\u000aAnd hold your tongue about it;\u000aConceal your knowledge to your own advantage,\u000aAnd you shall be free from poverty.\u000aOnly let your discovery remain a close secret.\u000aWe are now brought to the central definition of Alchemy, that it is the science of regeneration, of\u000afermenting the individual consciousness so that it soars to its own high root of perfection.\u000aThe word fermentation conveys an idea of the perfecting principle and of the possibility of\u000atransmutation beyond any other word, and also of the fixation or everlasting preservation of which\u000athey speak (explains Mrs. Atwood); and so of immortality, it is the best image of the Divine Art\u000awhich earthly processes give. Alchemy is a process of fermenting the vital spirit in and by its own\u000alight. The vital light is in the Universal as well as in the individual. In the Art the Individual draws\u000athe Universal.\u000a5. In each operation are certain implicits. The previously held confused, and automatic intellectual\u000aconcepts, those which have helped to crystallize consciousness and the emotional nature into a rigid and\u000arepressed entity, are to be broken down by a process of dissolution. The Raven must be decapitated.\u000aThe root of evil, of imperfection and confusion lying latent in consciousness - that which primarily\u000acaused the inhibition of emotion, and the compulsive motivation of the mind by the repression\u000amechanism - must be uncovered and recognized. Its clear recognition is in itself an act of destruction.\u000aFor no man, unless he be psychically compelled or bound by folly and utterly without volition or\u000acommon sense, will persist in a course of action which he knows will lead to his final destruction. With\u000arecognition comes an abreaction of the complex and a release of pent-up emotion and spiritual energy.\u000aThere is yet another sense in which this idea may be interpreted. As spirit is always in all systems\u000aof symbolism considered to be white in colour, pure in nature, and ubiquitous in its operation, so its\u000aopposite, the body and the personality, is symbolized by the colour black. By the decapitation of the\u000aRaven, a black bird, enjoined by Eudoxus, is meant a separation in understanding (thus the name of\u000aAlchemy, the Spagyric or separative art) of the head - the higher spiritual and intellectual principles from the lower part of the body, the world of conflicting desires and instincts. In Splendor Solis, by\u000aSolomon Trismosin, there is a fine elaborate drawing in which is shown a raven with a black body but a\u000awhite head, emphasizing this idea. It is the mystical death of the body. This can again be interpreted in\u000athe light of the quotation on a former page. That is to say, that the ancients considered two deaths to be\u000apossible. The one is the natural death which occurs to all men at the close of their particular span of life.\u000aThis is involuntary and inevitable. But there is another death which the sages and saints cultivate,\u000ainasmuch as it culminates in life and in fullness of spiritual perception. This is the death induced\u000a\u000aPage 48\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000athrough intense meditation and contemplation, when consciousness, indrawn into itself, and dissevered\u000afrom its bodily senses and functions, dies consciously and deliberately to this earthly life to function in\u000aa higher and nobler sphere.\u000aTo whiten the black is part and parcel of the same type of operation. Likewise, to vivify the white,\u000aself-immersion, or the deepest state of introversion, leads to a stimulation of the depths of the\u000aUnconscious, and an upwelling or vivification of the libido, or vital spirit. Once the process of\u000adissolution and separation is begun, the entire nature commences to undergo a transformation and\u000aequilibriation.\u000aYet as averred by Eudoxus, it is in the first operation that the true and preliminary dissolution,\u000awithout which nothing is of value, is begun. The dragon is the libido or vital spirit, undomesticated and\u000auntrained, as we have previously determined when examining The Golden Treatise of Hermes. Its\u000ablackness represents the degree in which it has become involved in matter and thus obscured; it\u000asymbolizes the evil in which it has become immersed by reason of its subordination to the tyrannical\u000aself-willed spirit, or consciousness. The blackness again signifies the preponderance of anxiety and fear\u000agenerated by consciousness, weighing it down, impeding its free circulation in the blood and bodily\u000asystem, and knotting it, so to speak, in the Unconscious levels from which it is unable to escape or by\u000awhich it is constantly dominated. To destroy this anxiety and to release the libido - more or less\u000asynonymous or simultaneous operations - by means of the magnetic trance is the first work. \u201cThe fire of\u000athe natural life entering into and fermenting the natural fire - the same life in another, opens the last, and\u000adevelops and excites and sets free the celestial Life and Light - that is one main principle \u2026\u201d\u000aThe result of such a state is, naturally, that upon which the whole hermetic work can proceed.\u000aReleased from restriction within the body by the impact of extraneous magnetism which is the external\u000afire, the inward fire or vitality can form a new life within. Left to itself in its freed state, the Light will\u000acirculate and form spontaneously its own new centre and vehicle. The Western alchemical conception is\u000apractically identical with that of the East. In the Chinese text, so ably translated by R. Wilhelm, there\u000aare a couple of sentences which are particularly apposite in this connection.\u000aThe Heavenly Heart is like the dwelling-place, the Light is the master.\u000aTherefore when the Light circulates the powers of the whole body arrange themselves before\u000aits throne, just as when a holy king has taken possession of the capital and has laid down the\u000afundamental rules of order, all the states approach with tribute; or, just as when the master is quiet\u000aand calm, men-servants and maids obey his orders of their own accord, and each does his work.\u000aTherefore you only have to make the Light circulate: that is the deepest and most wonderful\u000asecret. The Light is easy to move, but difficult to fix. If it is allowed to go long enough in a circle,\u000athen it crystallizes itself: that is the natural spirit-body.\u000aThis is the astral Body of Light, white and resplendent, the glowing Stone of the Wise, whose\u000apurified and glorified emanations glow as the aura, some glittering and flaming jewel of incomparable\u000ascintillation, invaluable, ineffable. One very fine occult scholar, John M. Pryse, describes the aura in his\u000awork The Apocalypse Unsealed. Speaking of the kundalini, which is the hermetic secret fire, he writes\u000athat it is this force\u000awhich, in the telestic work, or cycle of initiation, weaves from the primal substance of the\u000aauric ovum, upon the ideal form of archetype it contains, and conforming thereto, the immortal\u000aAugoeîdes, or solar body (soma heliakon), so called because in its visible appearance it is selfluminous like the sun, and has a golden radiance. Its aureola displays a filmy opalescence. This\u000asolar body is of atomic, non-molecular substance.\u000aThe psychic, or luna, body, through which the Nous acts in the psychic world, is molecular in\u000astructure, but of far finer substance than the elements composing the gross physical form, to whose\u000aorganism it closely corresponds, having organs of sight, hearing, and the rest. In appearance it has a\u000asilvery lustre, tinged with delicate violet; and its aura is of palest blue, with an interchanging play\u000aof all the prismatic colours, rendering it iridescent.\u000aIn the Pelican-phoenix references we have further rebirth symbols. Animals and birds always\u000arepresent in dream symbolism - and such symbolism is the language both of the Unconscious and\u000aalchemical writing - libido substitutes. The type of the animal defines the degree of domesticity and\u000acivilization, so to speak, attained by the libido. Released from its restriction and the prison in which it\u000ahas for so long been confined, the libido acts upon the entire nature through the blood, glands, and\u000aconsciousness itself, to form a resplendent interior ideal form. But even this latter requires to be\u000a\u000aPage 49\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000adissolved and fermented by its own analytical life - even as the Phoenix tears open its own breast in\u000aorder to feed its young with its own life-blood. The vitality of the Stone destroys its own basis in order\u000ato renew itself. The new solar form is derived from and based upon the former crystallized mental\u000asheath, as, of course, it must be. Compare with Osiris, who sings: \u201cThis is my body, which I destroy in\u000aorder that it may be renewed.\u201d\u000aHere the alchemical theory would seem not only to recognize but to develop the psychological\u000atheory so recently enunciated by Jung. The solution of the problem relating to the restoration of\u000aconsciousness to its own divine integrity lies not exclusively in a conversion into its opposite, though\u000athis of course is necessary. Actually such a process is imperative, for without this conversion\u000aconsciousness would be cut off from its archetypal roots and would tremble in mid-air without adequate\u000asupport. But the true solution lies in the retention of the former values of consciousness plus a\u000arecognition of their dynamic opposites in the personal unconsciousness.\u000aSo that, in speaking of this particular stage represented as the Pelican - a definite stage of progress alchemy announces that this libido-symbol too is to be destroyed, or overcome. Its point of view is\u000apartitive - even as is that of consciousness whose nature is to be transcended. We have here, it seems to\u000ame, a description of the transcendent function described by that master of European analytical\u000apsychology. For the text says that the Stone as it exists at this juncture - that is, full awareness of the\u000aopposite of consciousness - is to be dissolved. That is, the libido, or the spiritual energy, retreating\u000abefore the apparently insoluble conflict - the play between the conscious and the unconscious regresses and goes back even farther than the memories of early infancy. It sinks back into the depths or\u000adeposits of racial or ancestral life, and the mythological images resident in these profound levels of the\u000aunconscious awaken.\u000aThus \u201cbegins the separation of the elements in a philosophical manner\u201d. The task confronting the\u000apatient or the student is to differentiate the elements of his own personal unconscious from the\u000aprimordial archetypes or dominants of the collective unconscious, to enable the psychical energy to well\u000aup, activating and vitalizing the faculties and powers of consciousness itself. This separation of the\u000apersonal from the impersonal, and this differentiation of the ego and the non-ego, overcomes the\u000aintolerable pull of the opposites within the sphere of the patient, making possible a reconciliation which\u000aproduces a therapeutic and integrating effect upon his consciousness.\u000aThe Pelican, it may be remarked in conclusion of this symbolism, possesses under its bill a great\u000apouch in which it can preserve food, principally fish. If it wishes to regurgitate the food out of its crop\u000ato feed its young, it must rest its bill against its breast. It is conceivable that from this appearance there\u000adeveloped the legend that it tore open its breast in order to feed its young with its own life-blood. From\u000aearly times the Pelican was therefore used as a symbol of Christ, who shed his blood to redeem mankind\u000a- markedly a collective symbol. The alchemists represented the Philosopher's Stone, the red tincture, as\u000aa Pelican or the more fabulous Phoenix. For by its projection on the baser metals of its own personality\u000ait sacrificed itself and, as it were, gave its blood to tinct them. The libido thus no longer activates\u000aexclusively the primordial depths, but the ego, the child, can make use of it too.\u000aCertain of the latter alchemists have employed the Christ symbolism to represent the Stone.\u000aBringing Christ to birth within the soul of man is a fitting symbolism for such an operation.\u000aIn the second key is a continuation of the Pelican theme. The newly formed Stone must be\u000adissolved. The purification has not proceeded sufficiently far to render it permanent. The work cannot\u000abe accomplished by one operation. The trance state must be continued again and again, and persisted in\u000auntil consciousness finally eclipses itself, when it proceeds spontaneously to evolve in an entirely new\u000adirection of the pure from the impure must be achieved. The spirit, vitality, must be separated from\u000aevery level and type of consciousness, its soul and vehicle. This accomplished then the very elements\u000awhich constitute the residue can be changed and sublimated - or redirected into new and worthier\u000achannels.\u000a2. The central secret of the entire work is now approached. When employing the psychological\u000amethod, we associated the emotions and feelings with the philosophical Fire. When using the magnetic\u000ainterpretation, this correspondence did not seem very much to help us. We must look elsewhere for a\u000afurther and more complete explanation. There is the interpretation that the Fire is the penetrating power\u000aof the intellect, and this sometimes is the sense in which the author of The Suggestive Inquiry into the\u000aHermetic Mystery interprets the mystery of the secret fire. Various writers at various times have\u000aidentified it with a spiritual principle permeating and pervading the universe. Others identify it with the\u000afiery power of will. Possibly from all these hints we can proceed a step farther, and by amalgamation\u000aand synthesis produce a workable hypothesis.\u000a\u000aPage 50\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000a\u201cBehind will stands desire.\u201d So runs an alchemical aphorism. This can be assumed to imply that\u000adesire directs will, and gives to it an object to achieve. Or else it may imply that the basis or background\u000aof the Will is desire or emotion, and that the former has grown out of the latter, as an evolution or\u000asublimation, even as consciousness depends upon the Unconscious. The motive power of the instinctual\u000alife is the libido, desire, the vital spirit, while the motive power of the intellectual life is the Will. In its\u000adevelopments and peregrinations, in its eclipse by the magnetic trance state, the will loses its former\u000asense of direction. But having almost reached the verge of annihilation, so to speak, reaching the nadir\u000aof its life, it restores itself by an effort which is mighty beyond words. One step towards this divine\u000arestoration is the fierceness of its fire and heat, as though desperation towards life urged forth every\u000aounce of inherent vitality. At this stage, when it associates itself with and is given life by desire, the\u000aemotional nature, it is often called the Vitriol of Venus or the Green Lion, both implying the volitional\u000apower of penetration, fiery and crude, of immature but evolving spiritual energy.\u000aBut it's because of the transcendent force\u000aIt hath; and for the rawness of its source,\u000aOf which the like is nowhere to be seene,\u000aThat yt of us is named the Lyon Greene.\u000aSo wrote the Vicar of Malden some centuries ago.\u000aMrs. Atwood observes that:\u000aThe cause of the dissolution appears to proceed from the action of the vital heat stirred up\u000aartificially in the blood, and which, being so continuously triturated, ignites and opens for itself a\u000apassage, endeavouring forthwith to absorb the circulating light by the efflux of its own abundant\u000achloric spirit being transfixed.\u000aIn reality it is more than a suggestion that we find here - obscure though the passage may be. In\u000aorder to explain the implication of this passage, and the whole of the Atwood mesmeric hypothesis, it is\u000anecessary that we resort to various references in comparative religion, or at least to their practical\u000aaspects as may be perceived in such mystical arts as Yoga, Tantra, and meditation. From a study of\u000aTibetan Yogic practices we know that the development of the so-called external psychic heat - which\u000apermits the anchorite to live on mountain heights several thousand feet above sea level clad only in a\u000asingle cotton garment - is achieved by various forms of breathing. Let me quote a short passage from\u000aDr. Evans Wentz's recent work Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines, which deals precisely with this\u000asubject. He says:\u000aThe first of these (the six doctrines) is known to the Tibetans as Tummo, signifying a peculiar\u000abodily heat, or warmth, of psycho-physical character, generated by yogic means. According to the\u000asecret lore, the word Tummo refers to a method of extracting prana from the inexhaustible pranic\u000areservoir in Nature, and storing it in the human-body battery and then employing it to transmute\u000athe generative fluid into a subtle fiery energy whereby a psycho-physical heat is produced\u000ainternally and made to circulate through the nerve-channels of the psychic nervous system . . .\u000aAccording to our text, in practising, the art of Tummo the yogin must employ very elaborate\u000avisualizations, meditations, postures, breathings, directing of thought, training of the psychic-nerve\u000asystem, and physical exercises.\u000aBut as in Hatha Yoga and Tantra, great stress is laid upon the breathings themselves as the most\u000aimportant factor involved. The directions given in the Eastern texts as to the length of breathing,\u000aretention, and exhalation are very precise and elaborate. It is significant enough that any ordinary\u000aperson can produce quite a copious within a few minutes by means of regulated deep breathing and\u000aretentions.\u000aThe Yoga theory, which is very similar, and is in fact that from which the Tibetan one has been\u000aborrowed stipulates that in the air, quite apart from the combustible oxygen, is something which they\u000acall Prana, or life. But in order to illustrate the relationship of life and breath within the principle\u000apermeating all things, it is worth recapitulating the Hindu idea. Life, or prana, they say, is a universally\u000apervasive principle. It is the vital ocean in which the earth itself floats; it permeates the entire globe and\u000aevery being and object on it. It works unceasingly on and around us, pulsating against and through us\u000afor ever. In life we merely use a very specialized instrument, more so than any other, for dealing with\u000aboth Prana and Jiva. Strictly speaking, Prana is breath. As breath is necessary for continuance of life\u000a\u000aPage 51\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000ain the human machine, the Hindu philosophy considers that that is the best word. Jiva, on the other\u000ahand, means \u201clife\u201d, and also is applied to the living soul, for the life in general is derived from the\u000asupreme universal spirit itself. Jiva is therefore capable of general application as referring to the infinite\u000aand ubiquitous spirit; whilst prana is more particular as implying that specialized flow of life which\u000apermeates the human frame.\u000aParts of the mystical training of Yoga demand a prolonged charging of the entire system with an\u000aenormous amount of Prana, thus rendering the body rather like a powerful storage battery. Since,\u000aaccording to the theory delineated above, there is some connection between air and spirit on the one\u000ahand, and between the rate of inspiration and the motion of the mind on the other hand, illumination and\u000aspiritual attainment may be achieved by this technical method. So also is the psychic heat attained by\u000athe Tibetan hermit.\u000aFrom the practical point of view the Yoga theory demands a retirement from the world, or that a\u000agreat deal of time and attention be devoted to these practices. Hours each day must be spent in\u000amastering difficult postures, and in acquiring skill in pranayama and meditation. According to the\u000arecord of one practitioner that some years ago was shown to me, eight hours a day was devoted to\u000apranayama before finally a minor illumination flooded the mind. Clearly such a course is impossible for\u000athe average man of the West, no matter how great his sympathy for the Eastern ideal. He has at least\u000atwo thousand years of incessant activity, commercial bustle, and materialistic preoccupation behind\u000ahim. It would be a violation of his nature and his racial heredity to refute his ancestry and adopt the\u000aEastern hermit life.\u000aHence it is by some contended that the alchemistic and mesmeric theory is almost an ideal\u000aadaptation principally for such an individual. It is a European version of the Eastern Yoga technique,\u000adeveloped essentially for the evolving Western man. Since one phase of Yoga has as its primary object\u000athe deliberate and willed absorption of enormous quantities of spiritual energy, the Western methods\u000aadopt the same theory in its broad outlines. But its practice proceeds along entirely different lines.\u000aMagnetism, or prana, is imparted from operator to subject by the usual magnetic practical methods and\u000athen thrown back again by the subject to the former operator. In so doing it undergoes a fermentation\u000aand acceleration. As the presence of power increases and induces power, so the continual trituration and\u000afriction of the vital spirit causes an increase both of the energy and its potency. Its intensity is\u000aaugmented to a degree which is inconceivable. Its voltage, so to speak, is increased, the psychic state\u000aopened thereby transcending the mere impassivity of the ordinary mesmeric trance - developing slowly\u000abut gradually a charge or flow of libido which becomes so powerful in its intensity and quality as well\u000ato be named the Secret Fire of the Wise.\u000aHaving thus dilated and enlarged upon the fundamental bases of the Atwood hypothesis and\u000acompared it briefly with the Yoga practice of pranayama, it may be worth while to give Mrs. Atwood's\u000aown theory in her own words. First of all she castigates the modern (about I850) practice of the\u000aMesmeric art in these terms.\u000aIf, then, we go out at once to throw our common life to common lives (that is, impart our own\u000aunpurified and undeveloped prana to equally unpurified subjects), what wonder we have only\u000acommon results? That much depends upon the quality of the life imparted, general observation\u000ateaches; and with what sure corresponding consequences the moral leaven is attended may be\u000aunderstood, in a degree, by the recipient in the mesmeric trance. But the spontaneous fermentation\u000awhich the Vital Spirit undergoes, and the change that is thereby effected in the Passive Subject, is\u000anot taken advantage of in modern practice or pushed to the uttermost; much less is understood that\u000aexact art of grafting and transplanting which the ancients practised, and by means of which a\u000agrowth and sublimation of the Spirit was effected.\u000aAnd again, in describing the technical method whereby the grafting of the Vital Spirit\u000aproceeds, she declares:\u000aAs this life, being fermented by this life, its similar, leads into the common trance, or is\u000aentranced, so that consequent life, being fermented by its similar, leads into that third life which\u000amoves in and with the Creative Essence, so that the mind becomes in that case related to the\u000aUniversal Vitalizing Power, and so can act Its will . . . The fire of the natural life entering into and\u000afermenting the natural fire - the same life in another, opens the last and develops and excites and\u000asets free the celestial life and Light - that is one main principle . . . When one life being fermented\u000athrows its life to another equally fermented, a greater perfection is produced in the patient than was\u000a\u000aPage 52\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000abefore in the agent who imparts it. That is the law of progression of the vital force - sic itur ad\u000aastra.\u000aIt is in this last couple of sentences where the really significant secret is contained. It is in the\u000atransference of spiritual vitality, consciously and deliberately, from operator to subject, and back again,\u000aand retransferring the dynamic charge to subject, continuing the process again and again, which\u000adevelops the latent fire and awakens the life of the concealed and latent spirit. There are several\u000amethods already known to us for the fermentation or augmentation of the individual spiritual power\u000ainteriorly. Several of these I have summarized and described in my former work The Middle Pillar.\u000aSimplest among such methods is the art of rhythmic breathing. The ordinary Yoga theory postulates that\u000athe most familiar mechanism for dealing with and thus controlling and augmenting prana is the\u000amachinery of the lungs. By deliberately establishing a slow, measured rhythm of exhalation and\u000ainhalation of the breath, whilst formulating in the mind the idea of absorbing vitality from the universe\u000aabout one, the body and mind become very considerably charged with vitality. The method is\u000aexceedingly simple, requiring only a little patience and practice to become quite adept with it, and to\u000abenefit in no inconsiderable way by the increase of vitality and power which it imparts.\u000aA second method, rather more complex than the above, is that known as the Middle Pillar\u000atechnique, of which a brief description appears in The Art of True Healing. Its procedure is\u000afundamentally simple, providing for the imaginative formulation of various centres of Light placed on a\u000ashaft penetrating the body from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet. Names are imagined to\u000avibrate therein, and the combination of thought, sound, and colour awakens these centres to an\u000aequilibriated activity within. Such an activity throws into the psycho-physical system vast quantities of\u000ahigh-powered spiritual energy. This power, too, can be transmitted from one person to another with the\u000agreatest of ease, and that by a simple manual contact. It is my contention that anyone, sceptic or\u000aotherwise, by following the simple directions so far as the practical instructions are concerned, can\u000aprove for himself the validity of the magnetic hypothesis. Using this method for working up steam, as it\u000awere, as a preliminary to the practical application of the more complex and advanced Atwood\u000atechnique, considerable results should be obtained. In this connection it is worth stressing my belief that\u000aon the whole magnetic \u201cpasses\u201d do not conduce to a satisfactory transmission of power. There is\u000aconsiderable wastage of energy in so far as the method is not sufficiently direct. The Eeman method as\u000adescribed in Self and Superman should be studied as being most useful. The technique described by de\u000aPuységur is extremely efficient, and is really a vast improvement on the passes. That is to say, the\u000aoperator places one hand over the solar plexus or spleen of the patient and the other on the latter's head.\u000aLinked up in this way, he imagines himself to be a storage battery absorbing power from the universe\u000aand \u201cpumping\u201d it into his patient. Within a very few minutes both he and the patient obtain the marked\u000asensation of such transmission. Accompanying the Middle Pillar technique by rhythmic breathing\u000aenables the operator to absorb enormous quantities of vitality from the atmosphere and the universe\u000aabout him, thus rendering fatigue an extreme improbability. So long as the operator definitely realizes,\u000awith humility and a lack of egotism, that he is but a channel through which the cosmic forces may flow,\u000ahis ability to transmit energy is never impeded. If we consider the realm of therapy, it is only when\u000asuccessful cures imbue him with a sense of self-importance that trouble begins. He comes to consider\u000ahimself as a powerful healer, stressing his own personal abilities and forgetting that the spiritual power\u000ais not his own. Thus the channels become blocked, and there is a temporary cessation in the flow of the\u000aspirit through him.\u000aWith the channels wide open, vitality flows without impediment through the personality, and the\u000aapplication of the techniques of rhythmic breathing and the Middle Pillar will enable both operator and\u000asubject to fulfil easily the requirements of the Atwood hypothesis. Vitality as ordinarily experienced is\u000aof little value. But the power that invades the personality during the Middle Pillar practice is of such a\u000anature as will, when transmitted by the hands, ferment the being of the subject. If, after some time, the\u000asubject changes his rôle and becomes the operator and throws back the vitality to the former operator,\u000awho now becomes the subject, a considerable psychic change develops.\u000aThe common assumption that mesmeric methods are dangerous does not require much\u000aconsideration. All forms of therapy in one sense or another are dangerous. The whole of life is\u000adangerous. The mere attempt to cross a modern street is an undertaking which is fraught with the utmost\u000adanger when one considers the extreme probability that the turbulent surge of traffic may find yet\u000aanother victim. All the hypnotic authorities refute the charge that the practice of hypnotism has a\u000adeleterious effect upon the patient. Many of them cite subjects who have been hypnotized hundreds of\u000atimes without the least injurious result. On the other hand, it is easy to see that in the hands of an\u000aunscrupulous and dishonest operator serious harm may be effected. Nevertheless, this latter argument is\u000a\u000aPage 53\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000atrue also of medical and psychological practice. One has to be certain of the integrity and\u000atrustworthiness of one's physician or psychologist before submitting to treatment.\u000aA second objection is likewise without foundation. It asserts that the practice of mesmerism\u000ainterferes with the free function of the will, which faculty is precisely that which should operate in the\u000astudy of occultism. Hypnotism has been defined as an artificial method of obtaining a concentrated or\u000aabstracted state. It thus resembles meditation or concentration, when consciousness or the attention has\u000abeen withdrawn from the outside world and is focused upon one solitary idea. The difference is that in\u000athe former case the meditator is assisted by a second person, whilst in the other the state is self-induced.\u000aThus, from one point of view, it is said that the latter is infinitely superior in that one is not dependent\u000aupon any other person, being self-reliant and capable of controlling both the mind and the psychic\u000afaculties. One advocate of this point of view, Dr. Evans Wentz, writing in his most recent book, asserts\u000athat European critics of Yoga have thought that such practices induce a sort of self-hypnotism. If, in\u000asome degree, the criticism be well founded, we must, nevertheless, take into account the fact that\u000ahypnotization by one's own efforts has a far different result, in so far as experimental knowledge is\u000aconcerned. than hypnotization by another person. In self-hypnotization the yogin is wholly the master of\u000ahimself, whereas in hypnotic trance induced in one person by another the hypnotized subject loses\u000amastery of himself and is more or less enslaved to the will of the hypnotizer, and upon being released\u000afrom hypnosis has little or no conscious memory of the nature of the hypnotic state or the character of\u000athe mind's reactions to the external stimuli inducing that state.\u000aIt is only necessary to observe that this phenomenon of amnesia can be remedied quite easily with\u000arepeated hypnosis and by training. In fact, to adopt what is in my opinion a balanced and sane attitude\u000aone might state that an ideal form of training would be the conjoining of the analytical procedure of\u000apsychology, the induction of the mesmeric or somnambulistic state, and the practice of one of the occult\u000ameditation techniques. By these three methods any deficiency inherent in any particular technique could\u000abe remedied, and consciousness itself could be considerably enhanced.\u000aSo far as concerns the accusation that Yoga or meditation practices induce self-hypnotism, since\u000athat is assumed in a derogatory manner, much depends on the definition of hypnosis. On this subject\u000athere exists so much confusion, fear, and wrong thinking, due probably to the past abuses of theatrical\u000aperformers besides the romantic speculations of some too-imaginative novelists, that it is necessary to\u000aresort to a definition expressed on a former page. That is to say, in a few words, that the state induced\u000aby hypnosis is comparable in every respect to a condition of extreme introspection. The major\u000adifference is that the subject is assisted in the production of this one-pointed condition by a second\u000aperson guiding his consciousness along a predetermined track. Being in a highly concentrated mood,\u000aconsciousness is far more accessible to (a) upwellings of formerly unconscious material and to (b) the\u000aimplanting of suggestions for the furtherance of certain ends and for the evocation of corresponding\u000afaculties within. It all depends on how this condition is used as to whether good, that is desirable, results\u000ashall follow, or whether failure be one's reward.\u000aThe ideal of being \u201cwholly the master of himself\u201d in the case of the yogin is, from one point of\u000aview and from a legitimate and valid angle of argument, an instance of excessive individualism. In the\u000aEast the idea of co-operation between groups of people has never risen to the practical heights that the\u000aWest regardless of other of its defects, has achieved. It is far more common for Europeans to work one\u000awith another than is the case in the East. There it may be a commonly observed phenomenon for\u000adisciples to flock to gurus, but in the majority of instances it is hardly an organized affair.\u000aConsequently, the Eastern system is prone to elevate its own weakness, making a sublime virtue of what\u000ain reality is a psychological and neurotic defect. It is the old story of the fox who lost his tail. In the\u000aWest, co-operation as an ideal has gradually developed and slowly has been reaching its fruition.\u000aTherefore, even in spiritual and psychological things, we here see no harm in receiving assistance and\u000asupport from some other person. We consider it the most natural thing to do so. And, so it is argued,\u000athere can thus be no harm in the use of mesmerism or hypnosis as a means of obtaining proficiency in\u000athe meditative art provided in addition the subject is aware of two things. One, the integrity of his guide\u000aor teacher, so that he experiences no hesitancy or apprehension in submitting to the induction of\u000ahypnosis. And, two, that he realizes that in the last resort he must stand upon his own feet, and that to\u000arely exclusively upon the operator is a confession of extreme weakness which can be dangerous to his\u000aspiritual welfare.\u000aThis, at any rate, seems to be the import of the Atwood technique - a method whereby the cooperation of two interested individuals is employed towards a certain end, and that a spiritual one. With\u000athe proposed disintegration of the astro-mental sheath by a magnetic surplus, so to say, the theory holds\u000athat it is possible for the locked-up libido to be released and ascend more readily to the higher levels of\u000aconsciousness, there being available for general and immediate use. The two operations are\u000a\u000aPage 54\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000asynonymous and occur simultaneously. The deliberate breaking-down of the crystallized elements of the\u000apersonal sphere spontaneously releases the power latent within them. This release is tantamount to a\u000asublimation. That is to say it is a transfer of energy from a lower form of activity or level of\u000aconsciousness to a higher. And, as our text indicates, until this locked-up energy is released no further\u000asteps are possible.\u000aIndeed, this position is analogous to the Yoga system. No knowledge, true non-illusory knowledge,\u000aof the universe and of life is really possible without first having experienced some degree of Samadhi,\u000athe mystical experience. This attainment is engineered by several means, chief amongst which being the\u000atechnique of arousing the coiled-up, latent power called Kundalini, stored at the base of the spine. Once\u000aaroused, this power must be guided up the Sushumna in the spine to the brain. This ascent of vital\u000aenergy to the psycho-mental chakra in the brain, or rather above the crown of the head, induces a\u000acondition of consciousness which is characterized by the immediate acquisition of intuitive knowledge\u000aand by the experiencing of an ineffable bliss which is unlike any other experience in life. At the same\u000atime the realization of complete and absolute. freedom is obtained, as though every bond which tied one\u000ato the world and linked the world to one's own self were severed. In a word, the mechanisms of\u000aintrojection and projection of psychic qualities are realized in full consciousness, and overcome. Having\u000athus experienced Samadhi, the Yogi, being free for the first time, detached, and no longer enslaved\u000aeither by extraneous or subjective circumstances, can envisage life as it really is. As a consequence he\u000acan contemplate what further steps should be taken for his own evolution. And he will also see in a way\u000athat few other beings can see how he may help and not hinder his fellow man.\u000aThe second Key of Eudoxus informs us that the unfolding of the nature of consciousness cannot be\u000aundertaken without the preliminary dissolution of conscious restriction and inhibitions. The entire\u000amental sheath must be broken down in order that its psychic constituents may be rearranged in a\u000amodified and better form. Following upon this, the sublimation of libido can be accomplished. This\u000acondition of sublimation achieved, then the conversion of the elements is possible - that is,\u000areconstructing the Robe of Glory, the inner Body of Light - as well as the extraction and full realization\u000ain consciousness of the three Principles. These three Principles have been likened to Selflessness, with\u000aits opposite of Self for Mercury; Change, with its opposite of Stability for Sulphur ; and Sorrow, with its\u000aimplicit of Bliss for Salt. That is to say, these operations must permit the latent qualities and divine\u000apowers dormant in the various levels of the psyche, unknown and unsuspected by the ego, to expand\u000aand attain their maximum expression and development.\u000a4. The Sun and Moon are astrological symbols for male and female, positive and negative, the\u000apsychological equivalents of Consciousness and the Anima (or Animus) principle. The union of these\u000atwo dissevered constituents of the personality creates integrity and unity of being. And it is only the\u000awhole man, the equilibriated and balanced individual, who can truly initiate. The distillation is the\u000aspiritual energy which would circulate in such a person. It is this distillation which requires to be\u000amanumitted to the prepared subject. There it can ferment, and after repeated transferences arouse that\u000ainterior secret fire of the spirit within the blood which will dissolve the dull and unpurified stone. The\u000agreat Sea of the Wise is, as we previously determined., the Collective Unconsciousness or the higher\u000adivine Astral plane, the ubiquitous all-pervasive storehouse of magnetism vitality, feeling, and memory.\u000a5. Dissolved in this way, into what, for lack of other and better words, may be termed a\u000ahomogeneous magnetic fluid, the Stone may well be called the Vine of the Wise. As these hermetic\u000aprocesses go forward, and the fluidic substance matures and develops in the right direction, it is known\u000aas the philosophical Wine. The Wine is extracted from the Vine - that is, the dissolved constituents of\u000athe entire personality which, because of this dissolution, evinces a possibility of further and new growth.\u000aThe Wine represents the same substance symbolized by the Vine, but on a higher plane. Because of the\u000aattention we have given to it, the wine we extract and develop from the grape vine is a higher\u000adevelopment of the source from which it came. In that sense it is an evolution. We could likewise\u000asuggest that the Unconscious is the Vine, and the libido, which issues from the hidden depths of the\u000apsyche, answers to the Wine of which Eudoxus so enigmatically speaks. So far as this alchemical Wine\u000ais concerned, as it continues to be subjected to the coction and influence of the fire, further development\u000aincreases its virulence, so to speak, at which junction it is denominated as a most sharp Vinegar. It is an\u000aacid fluid continuing the process of disintegration yet further and in a more subtle way invading the\u000aentire mental and psychic sphere, as a preliminary to the reconstruction of the sphere of sensation on a\u000abetter and diviner plan.\u000aSome mention must be made of the consequent alteration in the blood-stream caused by glandular\u000asecretions stimulated and equilibriated by changes in both feeling and consciousness induced by the\u000aGreat Work. It is an empirical fact that mental and emotional changes are capable of inducing changes\u000a\u000aPage 55\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000ain the blood-stream and in the tissue structure of the physical body. We are all familiar with instances of\u000asudden and unexpected bad news at meal-times which has induced vomiting. The study of neurosis has\u000aalso provided us with innumerable examples of nervous and physical disturbances induced by adverse\u000apsychic activity. It is a psychological fact that neurasthenia, constipation, indigestion, arthritis, pruritis,\u000aand many other ailments are direct results of psychological causes. Sometimes to deal with the\u000apsychogenic factors eliminates or relieves physical symptoms. At others, direct physical therapy of\u000adifferent kinds is required to relieve mental symptoms of distress. In other words, mind and body may\u000anot be considered as two separate entities. The more accurate viewpoint might be that they are two\u000apoles of a single entity, two different functions adopted by that entity for the purpose of obtaining\u000aexperience and dealing with external life. They constitute, with the additional postulate of occult\u000aphilosophy of an astro-mental body, a direct continuum. Changes therefore occurring anywhere along\u000athat continuum, affecting any link, must produce inevitably a result or change in some other part of the\u000achain. Though I am not aware of any definite experiments, it ought to be possible to show that the\u000ablood-specimens of hypnotic-trance subjects exhibit alterations and a slightly different chemical\u000acomposition from those of ordinary persons. Hence in dealing with such powerful media as meditation,\u000amagnetism, and the reverse transmission of vitality, we are fairly certain to find that physical effects\u000ashould ensue. Transmutation thus becomes an actual physiological and experimental fact, the entire\u000aphysical frame becoming more sensitive, purified, and responsive to the delicate impulses transmitted to\u000aand from the consciousness dwelling within.\u000aThird Key. As we proceed in the examination of these Keys, the material becomes more and more\u000aobscure. The only saving grace is that we are counselled to continue as we have begun. Because of this\u000aadvice, and because I have been more prolix in the commentary to the two previous keys, I do not\u000apropose to examine the entirety of this third Key or those remaining. After noting certain points in the\u000afirst half of this key, I see no further necessity to continue. The student, in the light of the preceding\u000achapters, can examine the text as he wishes.\u000a2. The principal operation to be undertaken according to the description of this Key is the\u000aextraction of the three principles of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury from the comparatively homogeneous\u000abase called the Water of the Wise, or our Mercury. This is accomplished, as Eudoxus informs us, by a\u000a\u201cperfect dissolution and glorification of the body whence it had its nativity\u201d. It is also furthered or\u000aengineered by means of the Spirit, or Sulphur - the end being the union of the soul with the body.\u000aElsewhere this process is termed \u201cfixing the volatile\u201d. The soul would correspond to the airy volatile\u000anature of consciousness, Mercury, and it requires to be fixed or coagulated in a more or less solid\u000afoundation of the Salt, the body. And the text further clarifies the issue in the next verse: \u201cThis is the\u000aIntention, and the essential point of the operations of this Key, which terminate at the generation of a\u000anew substance infinitely nobler than the first.\u201d\u000a4. Slowly the issue becomes clearer, carrying on the exegesis from the end of the second Key.\u000aEudoxus speaks of the homogeneous substance, the philosophical Water, concealing the Three\u000aprinciples which are comparable to the spirit, soul, and (subtle) body. Here Eudoxus emphasizes a fact\u000awhich I stated above. For these three principles, like every other thing in nature, are not pure in their\u000anatural state, and to be purified need to be banished and separated prior to re-amalgamation. Hence the\u000aprocess begun originally requires to be continued so that a distillation is made of the homogeneous and\u000aamorphous astral base. A separation then occurs. A cleavage takes place, dividing the natural unity of\u000aMercury and Sulphur, soul and spirit, from their vehicle, the Salt. This earth, or Salt, remains fixed\u000awithin the physical body \u201clike a dead, black, and dreggy earth\u201d. Its life departed, the subtle sheath turns\u000ato putrefaction and decay.\u000a5. But even this dreg is of untold value. Nothing in the alchemical art is discarded, for \u201cNature\u000ateaches us\u201d so assert the Chaldaean Oracles, \u201cand the Oracles also affirm that even the evil germs of\u000amatter may alike be made useful and good\u201d. In her Memorabilia Mrs. Atwood remarks that \u201cthe\u000aprinciple of body is preserved in what they call the ashes, or Caput Mortum, and that, one principle\u000abeing saved, the whole life is restored from it; Khunrath calls it \u2018our pigmy\u2019, also the \u2018diadem of the\u000abody\u2019\u2026.\u000a6. Latent within the blackness of the ashes is life - interatomic life, which by no means can be\u000asnuffed out, and which sooner or later asserts itself, communicating movement and life to the mass.\u000aThere is a Oabalistic aphorism which has it that \u201cKeser\u201d (spirit or whiteness) \u201cis in Malkus\u201d (matter or\u000ablackness) \u201cand Malkus is in Keser, but after another manner\u201d. And again, it is said that within the\u000amaterial extreme of life, when it is purified, the Seed of the Spirit is at last found. Ultimately, there can\u000abe no distinction made between spirit and matter. The latter is a crystallization of the former, and spirit\u000a\u000aPage 56\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000ais a rarefied and sublimed form of matter. Matter is composed of molecules, these of atoms. By analysis\u000athe atoms are seen to be composed of still smaller particles, protons and electrons. These are considered\u000ato be positive and negative charges of electricity, whilst the latter, as energy, is a light radiation, the\u000amanifestation of the spirit in action. It is by the persistent subjection of the dregs to the fire of the Wise\u000athat the innate and implicit spiritual life and energy is stirred to renewed and desperate activity. The\u000ablackness is cast off, and the Salt is washed and purified. By these purgative means it is fixed, becoming\u000athe blood or the life of the Stone, the immortal substantive and energetic basis of the regenerated\u000aconsciousness.\u000a7. Fire and Water, being opposite, are yet mutually attractive. It is the age-old philosophy which is\u000ahere expounded. Spirit is the antithesis of Matter. Yet the attraction of the one for the other is so great\u000athat, like man and woman, male and female everywhere, without the other each is lost and incomplete.\u000aThe union therefore of spirit and soul is enjoined on us with great and emphasized earnestness. The one\u000ais the universal, all-pervasive life-force, whilst the other is an individualized particular unit of that\u000aenergy, made self-conscious through experience and immersion in matter. This union, apparently can\u000aonly take place through a third thing. They themselves are so extreme that it would seem impossible for\u000athem ever to be conjoined. Just as, with regard to an attitude towards life, it is comparatively easy to\u000achoose some one extreme viewpoint and follow that to the end. But it is infinitely more difficult to\u000aenvisage the two opposites in consciousness and attempt their union. Such an attempt is always\u000aforedoomed to failure. But one can succeed by formulating an entirely new point of view which does\u000anot consist exclusively of either of the two opposites. Or, to state it more properly, the ego reconciles\u000athem because it has risen above them. More technically, the spirit itself, or the libido, by regression to\u000athe Collective Unconscious, reconciles and unites them.\u000aThus it is that the alchemical tradition asserts that the union of the individual soul with the universal\u000aspirit can only ensue through the mediation of a third thing, the Earth, or the subtle Body of Light. It is\u000athis which is the medium and link between mind and matter.\u000a8. To repeat and to emphasize is oftimes to clarify. The author of this cryptic text now adds that\u000afire and water, though of different genders or polarities, are fundamentally and essentially of the same\u000anature. These are separated from their material basis by the mechanical and continued application of\u000afire. Having achieved a separation, the material basis, the Salt, is to be moistened occasionally by its\u000awater. That is, Mercury, actuated by Sulphur, which gives it volition, is to moisten or impregnate or\u000aindwell its former vehicle now in extremis.\u000aWhat formerly took place in archaic prehistoric epochs as an involuntary act of nature, now occurs\u000awith the full consciousness of the spirit. There is a descent of the spirit into matter, even as the gods of\u000athe solar myths descended into the underworld-repeating the original operations or phases occurring in\u000acosmic evolution. This descent moistens Earth with the Water, and also fixes the Spirit. The occurrence\u000ais dual in nature. The union of Salt and Sulphur, the two opposites, brings to birth once more the\u000aindividual consciousness, formerly eclipsed by the magnetic trance and the vital transfer. It may at first\u000abe thought that the joining of spirit and matter in this manner after their previous separation produces\u000athe identical unity which prevailed before. In point of fact this is not so, and the alchemists are adamant\u000ain their insistence upon the difference. Just as, in a magical ceremony, the invocation of an element into\u000aa clearer space after its prior banishing is not the same element as obtained before, but a purer\u000aquintessence of it, so by the spagyric art the unity of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury appears \u201cunder a more\u000anoble and more perfect form that it was before\u201d.\u000aAnother commentator chose to interpret this union as between Ruach, the mind or ego, and\u000aNeschamah, the Higher Soul or Fiery Mind, understanding. After this mystical union the elevated\u000aRuach returns as master to its proper union with Nephesch, the animal soul, whose nature is thus\u000afulfilled.\u000a9. The Stone we have already determined to be a term covering several concepts. At times it is a\u000amultiple concept including the three alchemical principles together. At other times, like the word\u000aMercury, it refers to the Quintessence, the crown and synthesis of the elements. On still other occasions\u000ait has application alone to the substantive principle of Salt, which is referred on the Qabalistic Tree to\u000athe Sephirah Hod, Splendour, to the element of Water, to the astrological planet Mercury, both these\u000alatter attributions representing energy and plasticity and fluidity of substance, the substance of the socalled astral sheath or Body of Light.\u000aThis paragraph teaches that from the Stone, the generic term for the homogeneous compound,\u000aissues Water. This divine Water can only be realized by our fiery dissolution. Here it becomes\u000anecessary to extend the significations of our elemental attributions. These symbols are infinitely elastic.\u000aIn certain forms of occult symbolism, to the Sephirah Hod is attributed the symbol of the cup. This Cup\u000ahas a special shape to express in symbolic form fundamental ideas. The base of the Cup is triangular, or\u000a\u000aPage 57\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000arather pyramidal. Upon this rests a circle, or sphere, whilst above this is a crescent, the actual bowl of\u000athe Cup. This can be made to yield several significant meanings. The base, being triangular, is the type\u000aand symbol of fire. Being pyramidal, it represents every aspect of fire - astral, solar., and terrestrial fire.\u000aThe circular symbol, by employing the symbology of the Hindu tattwa system, refers to the element of\u000aAir. Above the circle is the crescent, which by the same system of symbolism is attributed to the\u000aelement of Water. But see the section on symbols in Volume One of The Golden Dawn.\u000aNow, in their broadest significations, these three elements refer to the three fundamental divisions\u000aor aspects of man's psyche. The triangle of fire is attributed to the instinctive and emotional principle.\u000aAir, as we have previously determined, is the elemental characteristic of the mind; thus the circle\u000arepresents consciousness. The spiritual part of man, his aspirations and higher yearnings, his intuition\u000aand imagination, is represented by the crescent. Thus Air, consciousness, is the reconciler between the\u000aopposites. Man, symbolized by this formal symbol, is thus represented as a complete psychic entity\u000aopen always, if he will, to the influx of Keser, the universal spirit of life.\u000a\u000aFig. 3. - CUP SYMBOLISM\u000aThe employment of Water at this particular stage in our alchemical text implies the gradual coming\u000ainto operation of a spiritual principle. By the dissolution of the bonds that cramp and bind\u000aconsciousness, chains that hold it in thralldom to purely illusory concepts in conflict with reality, the\u000ainner spiritual life is released. This spiritual life is that which is represented by Water.\u000a10.Various properties and names are assigned to this fluid - depending upon certain stages reached\u000ain the working. But I gather that as the work is begun, through increasing the potency of the inward fire\u000aby a constant trituration and transfer, so it is continued. It is this which accomplishes the distillation.\u000aThat this Water has a lofty significance can hardly be doubted when one remembers the references\u000ain both sections of Scripture. Remember the passages in Revelations: \u201cAnd he showed me a pure river\u000aof water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.\u201d And again: \u201cI\u000aam Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of\u000athe water of life freely.\u201d\u000a12. Reiteration continues to emphasize that dissolution again is the preliminary operation. The\u000asubtle body, now separated from its informing principle, must be dissolved into its own homogeneous\u000aastral base, the Salt. It is this further process of dissolution which actually releases the full fiery blast of\u000athe inner fire.\u000aThe first applications of the alchemical fire are slow and gentle. Necessarily so. Gradually its heat\u000aincreases to a full and high intensity as the bodily and astral system slowly becomes accustomed to its\u000aforce. And it is this which, in time, produces the blackness of putrefaction in the body, which is the\u000asignal so desired. Future success in this type of working depends entirely and exclusively on this\u000acondition having been reached.\u000aThe precept of Senior quoted in the text is an extremely interesting one, and those who have\u000afollowed exegesis and have further applied their own intuitions may recognize its implication. The\u000ahighest fume is the vital spirit which in its temporary eclipse is reduced to the depths. Mercury is the\u000a\u201cdivine Water\u201d \u201cdescending from heaven\u201d, which by invading the psyche reduces or breaks down the\u000aastral form to its component principles or element. More accurately, so far as interpretation is\u000a\u000aPage 58\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aconcerned, we may assume that the psychological method is best applicable here. Mercury is the\u000aintellect pursuing the reductive method at first, and then synthesizing all things. At all events, the balm\u000aof life, which is the divine fire - as distinguished from the cruder elemental fire characterizing the lower\u000aand earlier forms of procedure - is concealed within the black ashes of the disintegrated body.\u000aAs remarked earlier, our symbolism switches over to, or is extended to include, the Supemals. The\u000alatter is a triad of divine powers commonly referred to as a unity. The trinity may be likened to the\u000anoumena or the divine roots of the elements, or the three aspects or facets of the Higher Soul, of the\u000acore of the Self, the It, and its vehicles of Wisdom, Will, and Understanding. This unit is latent and\u000acompletely dormant within the blackest ashes of matter and mind until, when apparently life itself is\u000aextinct, it stirs itself spontaneously into a new and emancipated revival. So awakened into renewed\u000aexistence, its action upon its concealing form is that of a purifying fire, of cleansing water, eliminating\u000athe last remaining fragments of impurity and blackness and evil. \u201cYour water shall be animated with\u000athis fiery essence, which works all the wonders of our art.\u201d\u000a\u000aFig. 4. - CADUCEUS SYMBOLISM\u000aThere is another symbolic form representing the principles inhering within the psyche which may\u000aprove a little enlightening. Its basis is the Caduceus of Mercury. The mode of interpretation employs\u000awhat are called the three Mother Letters of the Hebrew Alphabet. These are Aleph, Mem, and Shin.\u000aThese have elemental attributions. Since in the Qabalistic philosophy all things in the cosmos, and\u000aconsequently within man's psyche, have issued from the three major elements, rightly they may be\u000acalled Mothers. On the Caduceus, the letter Shin, three-pronged, is symbolic of the two overshadowing\u000awings, with the central stem. In the middle is the letter Aleph, to symbolize the two heads and necks of\u000athe crossing serpents. Whilst below is the letter Mem, symbolizing the rest of the intertwined serpents'\u000abodies. Thus we have the reverse of the Cup symbolism, which was a passive and receptive symbol,\u000awhereas the use of the three Mother letters is an active and masculine symbol. For above is the Fire, the\u000aletter Shin, whose numerical equivalent is a Hebrew phrase meaning the Spirit of the Gods, or the\u000adivine Spirit. It is reminiscent of that holy inspiring fire which descended upon the apostles, blessing\u000aand sanctifying them at Pentecost, endowing them with the gift of tongues. Inspiration, religious,\u000amystical, and artistic, is the result of its descent into the barrenness of man's psyche. Consciousness, the\u000atwo serpent-heads, is the letter Aleph referred to the element Air, for varying reasons which elsewhere\u000awe have discussed. Below is Mem, the passional nature of man, his animal soul, watery, turbulent, and\u000astormy at times; at others tending to reduce him to inertia and inactivity.\u000aOther interpretations of this fundamental symbolism may occur to the reader. But it is hardly\u000anecessary here to enter all the intricacies of interpretation. My object was primarily to suggest various\u000aforms of exegesis, and provide the barest outline of a means of such interpretation.\u000aFinally, and to conclude, there is one important and very difficult problem to consider. The basis of\u000aour interpretations, be they psychological, mesmeric, or magical, have all to do not with the physical\u000asubstance known as gold but with the production of an illumined condition of the psyche. By\u000acomparison with the psychic state of the average individual, such illumination may well be gold as a\u000asymbol by way of comparison with the gross lead of normality. There are other interpretations,\u000anaturally, and quite possibly there is a legitimate metallurgical one. If such is the case, 1 do not know it.\u000aIt may be left in the hands of metallurgists and chemists, for it does not concern my interests.\u000aWhat is of concern however, is the claim made by certain students of occultism and alchemy,\u000awhich is this: that the production of spiritual changes within the psyche, and the accomplishment of\u000athe interior transmutation, brings to light hidden powers previously dormant and latent in\u000aconsciousness. As a bald statement this is not so improbable. The protagonists of this theory,\u000ahowever, go further. They say that these powers are such as to give their possessor the ability, for\u000ainstance, to perform a physical transmutation. It is not impossible, they hold, to turn lead or other base\u000ametals into gold through the mediation of the inner psychic and spiritual faculties developed and\u000astimulated by the spiritual transmutation of the psyche. Whether any such illuminated person would\u000aconsider it worth while to attempt such transmutation is quite another story, though history affirms\u000asuch attempts - moreover, successful attempts.\u000aArthur Edward Waite, in his work The Secret Tradition in Alchemy, prefers to ignore\u000afundamental facts in occultism as well as the evidence of contemporary psychical research. He uses\u000ahis customary heavy artillery of criticism against this theory where a much simpler method of\u000a\u000aPage 59\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aconsideration would have been appropriate. He purports to despise this theory of the psychic\u000atransmutation of gold. In fact, he cites the protagonists of this theory as stating that although they\u000arealize fully the implications or possibilities of such transmutation they have not \u201cproceeded to the\u000apraxis\u201d. And from this Mr. Waite utters with attendant disparagements that such a feat is impossible.\u000aWhile fully conscious of the philosophic implications of the spiritual interpretation of the\u000aalchemical theory in so far as it relates to transmutation, I join my predecessors in confessing that I\u000atoo have not proceeded to the practice. But at the same time I am aware of the research and\u000adevelopment which has taken place in the past and is proceeding contemporaneously in modern\u000alaboratories. The evidence of psychical research is material which it would be unwise for any critic to\u000aignore, let alone ridicule. The various phenomena which do occur, and whose accuracy and\u000averisimilitude has been vouched for and attested by honourable and trustworthy men, indicates that\u000awithin man are strange and wonderful powers but rarely active in the normal individual. Not only so,\u000abut that these psychic factors are able to affect and influence the objective world to an extraordinary\u000adegree. Consider, for example, the phenomenon of apports. Objects, living and inorganic, make their\u000aappearance in the séance-room out of the blue. It seems as if the magical power activated within the\u000amedium is able to transplant objects in complete disregard of the laws of the three-dimensional world\u000awith which we are familiar, and to which we have become accustomed. How can we explain this\u000aphenomenon? Flowers are whirled into a room, closed, locked, and barred - apparently through the\u000afloor, ceiling, or the four walls from somewhere exterior to that room. Whatever the true explanation,\u000awe are face to face with powers of the psyche which may act upon so-called solid matter and change\u000aand modify its nature solely by psychic activity. In the face of the vast body of testimony collected by\u000apsychical research, quite apart from spiritualism, we may say that any individual who ignores such\u000atestimony is one who is a coward intellectually, afraid to accept any truth which does not conform to\u000ahis predilections.\u000aThis is one aspect of the subject. The other aspect may be less acceptable to critics, though its\u000avalidity is attested to by vast numbers of individuals, and by tradition, secular and religious. In the\u000aEastern spiritual philosophies it is a commonplace that devotion to the religious life, or the practice of\u000aspiritual techniques, quite definitely develops abnormal powers in the psyche. These are known in\u000aIndia as the Siddhis. Legend is rife as to the miracles, so-called, that may be achieved by fakirs,\u000aanchorites, and Yogis. Most of these with whom the average tourist comes into contact are manifestly\u000ahardly spiritual types. But for the purpose of our argument that hardly matters. These individuals have\u000afollowed the primary rule of occult practice. By doing certain things, certain results will follow. This\u000arule they have followed, and have achieved a certain control over mind and body, developing an\u000aenormous potential of will which is capable of acting directly upon material things. Such a philosophy\u000aof psychism, extended considerably so as to include spiritual development, is the only one which will\u000aexplain the miracles of Scripture. Most Western theologians, unable to explain these phenomena, and\u000aincapable of accepting them in the face of scientific criticism, have thrown them overboard, thus\u000ainterfering very considerably with biblical narrative and verisimilitude. By adopting the philosophy of\u000aYoga, or any allied or similar art, we have a complete explanation to hand. Through the pursuit of a\u000aspecialized and scientific study of the psyche, in various of its branches which are not included in\u000amodern psychological knowledge, the awakening spirit within manifests through the personality\u000aundreamt-of faculties and powers. The exercise of these spiritual powers are responsible for the\u000amiracles of both the Old and New Testaments and the scriptures of the East. Moreover, I suggest the\u000ainterested reader consult Hereward Carrington's excellent work on the psychic life of Christ entitled\u000aLoaves and Fishes.\u000aIn view of both these lines of evidence, the Yoga philosophy of India and modern psychical\u000aresearch, I see on theoretical grounds no valid reason why the interior psychical or magical power\u000ashould not be able to effect a physical transmutation. If this power can move a physical object without\u000aphysical contact; if it can exude its own subjective astral substance into objective materialization; if,\u000afinally, it can pass one solid object through another without injury or damage to either, why then should\u000ait not be able to rearrange the atomic structure of a metal? Theoretically, there is no reason why it\u000ashould not be so, and I feel confident that, although I have not proceeded to the practice thereof, the\u000afuture will demonstrate and confirm the truth of what these ancient students have affirmed. In doing so,\u000ait will rout with dishonour carping and over-critical students who, because of their long study and\u000asupposed insight into the subject, should know better. It is time that such were silenced.\u000a\u000aPage 60\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aCHAPTER EIGHT\u000aTHE MAGICAL VIEW\u000aWE have so far considered the most important theories concerning the non-metallurgical aspect of\u000aAlchemy. It must be admitted that the psychological and the magnetic theories are the most important\u000aand yield the most significant material. Yet there is a third viewpoint which is worth consideration here\u000a- I refer to the magical theory. It touches so closely on the alchemical practice that to ignore it would be\u000ato neglect a highly informative branch of research. In other of my works I have dealt fully, more or less,\u000awith the objects and nature of magical practices. It may be remarked that from the widest point of view\u000athe psychological approach borders very closely on the maaical one. As Jung remarks in his\u000acommentary to The Secret of the Golden Flower:\u000aMagical practices are the projections of psychic events which, in cases like these, exert a\u000acounter influence on the soul and act like a kind of enchantment of one\u2019s own personality. That is\u000ato say, by means of these concrete performances the attention, or, better said, the interest, is\u000abrought back to an inner sacred domain which is the source and goal of the soul. This inner domain\u000acontains the unity of life and consciousness which, though once possessed, has been lost and must\u000anow be found again.\u000aThus the objects of Magic are to bring the student to an awareness of his own divine nature, to\u000aenable him consciously to integrate and unite the several constituents of his own psyche. It is to effect\u000apsychological integration, to bring about a psychic release from bondage to unconscious pro,jection,\u000aand to produce an exaltation of consciousness to the Light, that any legitimate magical initiating system\u000aowes its existence. The function of every phase of its routine, the avowed intention of its principal\u000arituals, and the explicit statement of its teachings is to assist the candidate by his aspiration to find that\u000aunity of being which is the Inner Self, the pure essence of Mind, the Buddha-nature. Thus the entire\u000aobject of Magic and all mystical training \u201cis, by the intervention of the symbol, ceremonial and\u000asacrament, so to lead the soul that it may be withdrawn from the attraction of matter and delivered from\u000athe absorption therein, whereby it walks in somnambulism, knowing not whence it cometh nor whither\u000ait goeth\u201d.\u000aAll magical initiations require the presence of initiating officers. From one point of view such\u000aofficers represent just such psychic projections as Jung refers to. They represent, even as figures in\u000adreams do, different aspects of man himself, personifications of psychological principles active within\u000athe psyche. Through the admittedly artificial or conventional means of a dramatic projection of these\u000apsychic principles in a well-ordered ceremony a reaction is induced in consciousness. This reaction is\u000acalculated to arouse from their dormant condition those hitherto latent faculties represented objectively\u000aby the officers. Without the least conscious effort on the part of the candidate an involuntary current of\u000asympathy is produced by the external delineation of psychic faculties which may be sufficient to\u000aaccomplish the purpose of the ceremony. The aesthetic appeal to the imagination, quite apart from what\u000aI would call the intrinsic magical virtue of the ceremonial, stirs to renewed activity the life of the inner\u000adomain. And the entire action of this type of dramatic initiatory ritual is that the soul may discover itself\u000awhirled in exaltation.to the heights, and during that mystical elevation receive the influx of the Light.\u000aThus, to refer to one practical magical scheme practised in the Order of the Golden Dawn, and\u000adescribed at length in my book My Rosicrucian Adventure, there is a preliminary ritual called the\u000aNeophyte Grade. To operate this properly, several officers are required. The Kerux personifies the\u000areasoning faculties. He is the intelligent part of the mind, functioning in obedience to the Will; the\u000aQabalistic Ruach, in a word. The higher part of that mind, the aspiring, sensitive, and the intuitive\u000aconsciousness, the Neschamah, is represented by the Hegemon, who ever seeks the rising of the Light.\u000aThe active will of man is signified by the Hiereus, the guardian. against evil. In this initial ceremony of\u000aNeophyte the Hierophant acts on behalf of the higher spiritual soul of man himself, that divine self of\u000awhich but too rarely, if ever at all, we become aware. \u201cThe essence of mind is intrinsically pure\u201d is a\u000adefinition of one Buddhist sutra, and it is this essential state of enlightenment, this interior Self, Osiris\u000aglorified through trial and perfected by suffering, which is represented by the Hierophant on the dais.\u000aHe is seated on the throne of the East in the place of the rising Sun, and with but two or three exceptions\u000anever moves from that station in the Temple. He represents that innermost core of the psyche which,\u000aitself, moves not, though it directs the other officers and initiates, and commands movement and\u000aactivity. From his aloof spiritual stronghold this higher Genius gazes down upon its alter-ego, terrestrial\u000a\u000aPage 61\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aman, evolved for the object of providing it with experience. Seldom does that Genius leave its palace of\u000athe stars except when, voluntarily, the lower self opens itself to the higher by an act of sincerest\u000aaspiration or self-sacrifice, which alone makes possible the descent of the Light within the heart and\u000amind.\u000aNow, it is upon the Hierophant and his activity that the efficacy of initiation depends. Without an\u000aunderstanding of the magnetic theory, no likelihood of realizing the rationale of initiation is possible.\u000aThe central factor of initiation consists in the communication of spiritual power from the Hierophant to\u000athe candidate by a physical and magnetic contact. There is one point in the ceremony when the\u000aHierophant leaves the Throne of the East, representing the Higher Self in action. As Osiris he marks the\u000aactive descent of the supernal splendour. While leaving the dais, with wand uplifted, he utters: \u201cI come\u000ain the power of the Light. I come in the Light of Wisdom. I come in the Mercy of the Light. The Light\u000ahath Healing in its Wings.\u201d And having brought the Light symbolically to the aspirant he retires to his\u000athrone, as though that divine Genius of whom he is the Temple surrogate and representative awaits the\u000adeliberate willing return of the aspirant himself to the everlasting abode of the Light.\u000aIn actual practice, in modern times, most Hierophants have contented themselves solely with the\u000asymbolic gesture and speeches. The real significance of the movement, as a practical magnetic\u000atechnique, has not suggested itself to them. In point of fact, whilst moving from the dais towards the\u000acandidate at the altar, the Hierophant should be stirring up within himself the magical or spiritual power\u000ato such an extent that it emanates powerfully from him. There are means and techniques by which this is\u000apossible. Such are the Middle Pillar technique, the assumption of God-forms, rhythmic breathing,\u000asimple but sincere aspiration, prayer, and many another method. The emanation of the spirit entering the\u000asphere of the candidate produces, should the charge be strong enough, a powerful effect.\u000aThere is another point, just previous to the one mentioned above, when the Hierophant stands at the\u000aaltar facing the kneeling Neophyte. Whilst the latter aspires strongly by the recitation of an obligation\u000adefining his purpose and intention., the Hierophant takes hold of his left hand. It is this action which, in\u000amy estimation, constitutes the principal gesture of successful initiation. For it is then that the Hierophant\u000ais able, if he knows his business, to transfer a vital stream of spiritual energy from himself along a\u000aphysical line of conduction to the candidate.\u000aNow, it is here that we have an analogy to the Atwood conception of alchemical practice. We have\u000aseen that the primary operation in Alchemy, regardless of the mode of interpretation, is the solution.\u000aAccording to the Atwood theory, such a solution was accomplished by means of the transference of\u000amagnetism or spiritual energy from operator to subject. This transference induced a trance state in the\u000asubject. That is, by this means a specific change is induced in consciousness. The resemblance of this\u000atheory to the action of the Hierophant in magical initiation is at once striking. There is one marked\u000adifference however; no trance state is produced by the ceremony itself. On the other hand, quite\u000afrequently the candidate at such initiations confesses afterwards to a sense of confusion or \u201cmuzziness\u201d,\u000aas though some degree of separation, or inhibition of consciousness, had been induced.\u000aMoreover, the action of this Neophyte ceremony is intended - so runs the rubric attached to the\u000aritual - deliberately to produce a species of schizophrenia. It is believed that the various principles\u000acomprising man become temporarily dissociated. A highly intricate account of the condition of these\u000adissociated psychic functions may be found in Volume III of my work The Golden Dawn, section Z.3.\u000aSo striking is the resemblance of the Atwood technique to the magical one that 1 am profoundly\u000aconvinced that the magnetic interpretation, when raised to a higher level and developed to its highest\u000amagnitude, is at the basis of ceremonial initiation. Thus the preliminary Neophyte ritual has a definite\u000aconnection with the Alchemical dissolution. And like that operation of dissolution, upon the efficacy of\u000athat Neophyte initiation ceremony does the success of the remaining initiations depend. Should the\u000aHierophant be successful in communicating, with the help of his fellow officers, a magnetic or spiritual\u000acharge to the candidate, that charge acts as a ferment. Slowly but surely in the months ensuing after the\u000aceremony the vital ferment stirs up the psyche of the aspirant, unconsciously breaking down resistances\u000aand crystallizations, to the end that Light may enter his mind.\u000aThe five grades that follow have as their object the awakening of the elemental bases of what must\u000adevelop into the instrument of the higher. Awakened and purified, they may be consecrated to the Great\u000aWork that they may become worthy vehicles for the indwelling of the Light. First, however, it is\u000anecessary that they be awakened. For, psychological truism that it is, until their presence is divined their\u000atransmutation cannot be accomplished. We have here, again, a definite point of contact with the\u000ahermetic technique. For after the dissolution of the inner psychic vehicle into its own homogeneous\u000abase there must follow the conversion of the elements. This process, as we assumed before, implies a\u000aprocess of becoming aware of them. The importance and significance of this step becomes imperious if\u000awe define the elements as fundamental levels of the Unconscious aspect of the psyche, the broadest\u000a\u000aPage 62\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000adivisions of its structure. Once more the magical technique links up with the psychological method. For\u000aboth aim, though by different methods, at eliminating resistance, and in making conscious the vast\u000ainspiration, dynamic energy, and memory concealed in the deeper portions of man\u2019s psyche. In\u000asymbolic form and pageantry, therefore, the initiation ceremony of each grade calls forth the spirits of a\u000aparticular element. And as a steel placed in close proximity to a magnet receives some degree of its\u000amagnetism, and comparable to the electrical phenomenon of induction. so the presence of power\u000ainduces power. Contact with the appropriate type of elemental force produces an identical type of\u000areaction within the sphere of the Neophyte, and it is thus that growth and advancement proceeds.\u000aThe element offered for the work of transmutation in the grade of Zelator is the earthy part of the\u000aCandidate. Here is the beginning of the alchemical conversion of the elements. The ritual symbolically\u000aadmits him to the first rung of that mighty ladder whose heights are lost in the Light above. The first\u000arung is the lowest sphere of the conventional Tree of Life, Malkus. To it is ascribed the first grade and\u000athe element of Earth. After the Earth elementals are invoked the Candidate is ceremonially conducted to\u000athree stations, the first two being those of evil and the higher divine presence. At each of these Stations\u000athe Guardians reject him at the point of the sword, strongly urging him in his unprepared state to return\u000awhence he came. His third attempt to go forward places him in a balanced position, the path of\u000aequilibrium, the Middle Way, where he is received. And a way is cleared for him by the Hierophant\u000awho again represents the celestial soul of things. During his stay in the Temple the stability of the\u000aelement is established within his consciousness. that eventually it may prove an enduring temple of the\u000aHoly Spirit.\u000aThe grade after the Earth Ceremony is that of Theoricus. It is referred to the ninth Sephirah on the\u000aTree, Yesod, the foundation, and to it are attributed the sphere of the operation of Luna and the\u000areflection of the element Air. Here the candidate is conducted to the stations of the four Kerubim, the\u000aAngelic choir of Yesod. The Kerubim are defined by Macgregor Mathers in his Qabalah Unveiled as\u000athe presidents of the elemental forces, the vivified powers of the letters of Tetragrammaton operating in\u000aand through the four elements. Each element is by this system of attributions ruled by a Kerub under the\u000aaegis of one of the letters of YHVH, the Ineffable Name. It is always through the power and authority\u000aand zodiacal symbol of the Kerub that the elemental spirits and their rulers are invoked. At this juncture\u000aof the ceremony with the Airy elements vibrating about and through him, the Zelator is urged to be\u000aprompt and active as the Sylphs, but avoid frivolity and caprice. Be energetic and strong as the\u000aSalamanders, but avoid irritability and ferocity. Be flexible and attentive to images, like the\u000aUndines, but avoid idleness and changeability. Be laborious and patient like the Gnomes, but\u000aavoid grossness and avarice. So shalt thou gradually develop the powers of thy soul, and fit thyself\u000ato command the spirits of the elements.\u000aThe third grade is that of Practicus referred to the Sephirah Hod, Splendour, the lowest of the lefthand Sephiros on the Tree, the so-called Pillar.of Severity. Its attributions refer to the sphere of the\u000aoperation of the Planet Mercury, but more especially to the element of Water which is invoked to power\u000aand presence. Two paths lead to this sphere of Splendour - the path of Fire from Malkus and the\u000areflection of the sphere of the Sun from Yesod. (For clarification of the idea of the Paths between the\u000aSephiros, the reader must be referred to my book A Garden of Pomegranates.) Water is germinative\u000aand maternal, whilst fire is paternal and fructifying; from their interior stimulation and union is the\u000ahigher life born even as has been said, \u201cExcept ye be baptised with water and the Spirit ye cannot enter\u000athe Kingdom of Heaven.\u201d Therefore in this grade the Candidate\u2019s sphere, symbolized by stagnant water,\u000ais by the presence of solar and fiery elements vitalized and rendered a perfect creative base. The\u000aemotional life, through the impact of the elemental initiations and contacts, thus becomes enormously\u000astimulated and a terrific impetus is communicated to the Unconscious psyche.\u000aThe fourth grade of Philosophus carries the candidate another step forward. The Sephirah involved\u000ais Netzach, Victory, to which is referred the operation of the Planet Venus and the element of Fire,\u000awhile the paths that connect to the lower rungs of the ladder are principally of a watery nature. Thus the\u000aelements ceremonially encountered are of an identical nature with those of the preceding grade. Here,\u000ahowever, their order and power is totally reversed. Previously the Water was predominant. Now the\u000aFire rages and whirls in lurid storm, with Water only as the complementary element whereon, or\u000athrough which, it may reveal itself, and in order that due equilibrium may be maintained. These two are\u000athe primary terrestrial elements which, intelligently controlled and creatively employed, may lead\u000aeventually to the restoration of the Golden Age. And by their transmutation a new paradise may be\u000arecreated from the darkness and chaos into which it formerly had fallen. For the Light may not\u000alegitimately be called forth upon man nor dwell within him until chaos has been turned into equilibrium\u000a\u000aPage 63\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aor complete realization and enlightenment. And until order has been restored to the lower elements of\u000ahis earthly kingdom neither peace nor inner security may be his rightful lot.\u000aThough Fire and Water, warmth and moisture, feeling and emotion raised to their maximum\u000aintensity are essentially creative, their stimulation within the being of the Neophyte draws his attention,\u000aperhaps for the first time, to the chaotic condition of his natural existence, and the complete psychic\u000amuddle into which his ignorance and spiritual impotence have stranded him. Evocative of the highest\u000awithin his soul, equally these elements call forth that which is base and low, those parts of himself\u000awhich because of undue repression have grown revengeful and cruel. The first steps in the magical\u000awork, as in alchemy, are analytical - the levelling down of all that man formerly held true and holy. An\u000aunhappy state but a very necessary one if progress is to be made and if the chaos is to be transcended.\u000aFrom these ruins may be erected the new temple of Light; it is always from the rubbish heap that are\u000aselected the materials for the manifestation of god-head. These symbols have a dual application. Not\u000aonly do they refer to the epochs of creative evolution whose memory has long since faded even from the\u000avisible memory of Nature, but also to the recapitulation of those periods within consciousness itself.\u000aAnd it is in connection with these recapitulations that \u201cthe aspirant on the threshold of Initiation\u201d,\u000aobserves Aleister Crowley, \u201cfinds himself assailed by the \u2018complexes\u2019 which have corrupted him, their\u000aexternalization excruciating him, and his agonized reluctance to their elimination plunging him into\u000asuch ordeals that he seems (both to himself and to others) to have turned from a noble and upright man\u000ainto an unutterable scoundrel\u201d. These are the experiences and events which occur to every aspirant\u000awhen initiation forces the realization upon him that \u201call is sorrow\u201d. In fact, the hallmark of successful\u000ainitiation and alchemical practice would seem to lie in the occurrence of these or similar experiences the increased awareness of conflict. The whole universe under the stimulation of the magical elements\u000aand inward analysis seems to tumble like a pack of cards crazily about one\u2019s feet. This is the first half of\u000athe alchemical solvé et coagula formula. Analysis or dissolution must precede synthesis. Corruption is\u000athe primitive base from which the pure gold of the spirit is drawn. So far as the nature of the\u000aenvironment and personal understanding and creative capacity permit, the task implied by the coagula\u000aformula is to assemble them and remould them nearer to the heart\u2019s desire.\u000aThe Philosophus grade completes the four elemental initiations. In the candidate\u2019s consciousness\u000ahave been implanted the seeds of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, and thus the alchemical conversion of the\u000aelements has been accomplished. As explained on a former page, the magical philosophy postulates a\u000afifth element which acts as the Ouintessence or synthesis of the other four. Following the Fire grade,\u000atherefore, comes the Grade of the Portal. This conferred upon the candidate the title of the Lord of the\u000aPaths of the Portal of the Vault of the Adepti, and is not referred to any Sephirah as such. Its technical\u000aattribution is the element of Akasa, Spirit or Ether. It is intermediate between the elemental grades and\u000athe higher spiritual attainments beyond. A crown to the four lower elements, the Rite formulates above\u000aEarth, Air, Water, and Fire, the uppermost point of the Pentagram, revealing the administration of the\u000aLight over and through the kingdom of the natural world. It concerns itself with a recapitulation of the\u000aformer grades, co-ordinating and equilibriating the elemental self which, symbolically sacrificed upon\u000athe mystic altar, is offered to the service of the higher Genius. Not only does this Grade concern itself\u000awith the Quintessence or the Mercury of the Philosophers, but it carries the alchemical procedure a step\u000aanother definite similarity to the hermetic technique. The second and Third Adepts, two of the initiating\u000aofficers, bear in their hands wands which are surmounted by alchemical symbols. The former represents\u000athe principle of Sulphur, whilst the latter represents Salt. The Hierophant, or Chief Adept as he is\u000anamed at this stage, bears a wand marked to represent all three principles of Mercury, Sulphur and Salt.\u000aThe grade then clearly corresponds to a stage in the alchemical Art. Not only is the concept of the\u000aQuintessence developed in so far as it is the synthesis of the four elements, but it is taught that within it\u000aare concealed the Three Alchemical Principles. The functions of the higher grades must be then to\u000adevelop these principles, to separate them from their base, and to become fully and consciously aware\u000aof their implicits.\u000aA gestation period of at least nine months elapsed prior to initiation to the Adeptus Minor grade, a\u000agrade which is excessively difficult to describe except by quotation from the Ritual concerned. Its\u000afunction explains itself in these terms: \u201cBuried with that Light in a mystical death, rising again in a\u000amystical resurrection, cleansed and purified through him our Master, 0 brother of the Cross of the Rose.\u000aLike him O Adepts of all ages have ye toiled; like him have ye suffered tribulation. Poverty, torture, and\u000adeath have ye through. They have been but the purification of the Gold. In the alembic of thine heart.,\u000athrough the athanor of affliction, seek thou the true stone of the wise.\u201d\u000aThe chief characteristic of this grade is that it marks at least symbolically the attainment of a\u000adistinct phase of spiritual realization. In a fascinating and extremely brilliant way, the entire structure of\u000athe ritual emphasizes and connives to induce this phenomenon. At one juncture of the ceremony, the\u000a\u000aPage 64\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000acandidate is affixed to a large upstanding Cross. Thereon under the most solemn circumstances he is\u000aobliged to assume a sacred vow. The officiating adept reads several phrases first, and the candidate\u000arepeats them. It is not difficult to realize that this is a difficult and important phase of the Ceremony.\u000aDuring this obligation because of the symbolism attached to it, and because of the active aspiration\u000awhich is induced at this stage, illumination may quite easily occur, and very often does. Provided,\u000anaturally, that the officers fulfil their part. The object of the ceremony as a whole \u201cis especially intended\u000ato effect the change of the consciousness into the Neschamah, and there are three places where this can\u000atake place. The first is when the aspirant is on the Cross, because he is so exactly fulfilling the symbol\u000aof the abnegation of the lower self and the Union with the Higher Self\u201d. Suffice to mention that he is\u000anow entitled to undertake a definite magical training after this grade, a training which comprises\u000ainstruction in the art of meditation, visualization, assumption of God-forms, awakening of the inner\u000apsycho-physical centres or chakras, etc. It is unnecessary here to give further details of the magical\u000arituals; interested readers will discover full details in My Rosicrucian Adventure and The Golden Dawn.\u000aThus, the entire direction of Magic is more than comparable to Alchemy. Both lead from a dissolution\u000aof the psychic crystalizations by the light and power of the spirit towards a free and active manifestation\u000aof the spiritual self. Being \u201cbrought to the Light\u201d is a very apposite description of the great Work. This\u000aexperience of the rising of the Light is common to mystics of every age and of every people. It is an\u000aexperience of the greatest significance, a goal marking an attainment, the achievement of a distinct\u000aevolution. It is an ineffable experience, however, which defies definition, as well in its elementary\u000aflashes as in its most advanced transports. No code of thought, philosophy or religion, no logical\u000aprocess can bind or limit it. Always does it represent, spiritually, a marked attainment, a liberation from\u000athe perplexing turmoil of life, from conflict, and from every psychic complication. As\u000aJung has expressed it, it \u201cthereby frees the inner personality from emotional and imaginary\u000aentanglements, creating thus a unity of being which is universally felt as a release\u201d. It is the attainment\u000aof spiritual puberty, a significant stage m spiritual growth, marking the proper concoction of that\u000aprecious gem, the Stone of the Wise, and fulfilling the complete transmutation of the bodily lead into\u000athe gold of full soul-realization in consciousness.\u000a\u000aPage 65\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aCHAPTER NINE\u000aCOELUM TERRAE\u000aOr The Magician's Heavenly Chaos.\u000aBy Thomas Vaughan.*\u000aI HAVE now, Reader, performed my promise and - according to my posse - proved the antiquity of\u000amagic. I am not so much a fool as to expect a general subscription to my endeavours. Every man's\u000aplacet is not the same with mine; but \u201cthe die is cast\u201d. I have done this much, and he that will overthrow\u000ait must know, in the first place, it is his task to do more. There is one point I can justly bind an\u000aadversary to - that he shall not oppose man to God, heathen romances to Divine Scriptures. He that\u000awould foil me must use such weapons as I do, for I have not fed my readers with straw, neither will I be\u000aconfuted with stubble. In the next place, it is my design to speak something of the Art itself, and this I\u000ashall do in rational terms, a form different from the ancients; for I will not stuff my discourse like a\u000awilderness with lions and dragons. To common philosophers that fault is very proper which Quintilian\u000aobserved in some orators: \u201cThe summits of their structures are in evidence; the foundations are hidden.\u201d\u000aThe spires of their Babel are in the clouds, its fundamentals nowhere. They talk indeed of fine things\u000abut tell us not upon what grounds. To avoid these flights, I shall in this my olla - for I care not much\u000awhat I shall call it - observe this composition. First, I shall speak of that one only thing which is the\u000asubject of this Art and the mother of all things. Secondly, I will discourse of that most admirable and\u000amore than natural Medicine which is generated out of this one thing. Lastly - though with some disorder\u000a- I will discover the means how and by which this Art works upon the subject; but these being the keys\u000awhich lead to the very estrado of Nature, where she sits in fun solemnity and receives the visits of the\u000aphilosophers, I must scatter them in several parts of the discourse. This is all, and here thou must not\u000aconsider how long or short I shall be but how full the discovery; and truly it shall be such and so much\u000athat thou canst not in modesty expect more.\u000aNow then, you that would be what the ancient physicians were, \u201cthe health-giving hands of the\u000agods\u2019, not quacks and salvos.of the pipkin; you that would perform what you publicly profess and make\u000ayour callings honest and conscionable: attend to the truth without spleen. Remember that prejudice is no\u000areligion and by consequence hath no reward. If this Art were damnable you might safely study it\u000anotwithstanding, for you have a precept to \u201cprove all things\u201d but to \u201chold fast that which is good\u201d. It is\u000ayour duty not to be wanting to yourselves; and for my part - that I may be wanting to none - thus I\u000abegin.\u000aSaid the Kabalist: \u201cThe building of the Sanctuary which is here below is framed according to that\u000aof the Sanctuary which is above.\u201d Here we have two worlds, visible and invisible, and two universal\u000aNatures, visible and invisible, out of which both those worlds proceeded. The passive universal Nature\u000awas made in the image of the active universal one, and the conformity of both worlds or Sanctuaries\u000aconsists in the original conformity of their principles. There are many Platonics - and this last century\u000ahath afforded them some apish disciples - who discourse very boldly of the similitudes of inferiors and\u000asuperiors; but if we thoroughly search their trash it is a pack of small conspiracies - namely, of the\u000aheliotrope and the sun, iron and the lodestone, the wound and the weapon. It is excellent sport to hear\u000ahow they crow, being roosted on these pitiful particulars, as if they knew the universal magnet which\u000abinds this great frame and moves all the members of it to a mutual compassion. This is an humour much\u000alike that of Don Quixote, who knew Dulcinea but never saw her. Those students then who would be\u000abetter instructed must first know there is an universal agent, Who when He was disposed to create had\u000ano other pattern or exemplar whereby to frame and mould His creatures but Himself. But having infinite\u000ainward ideas or conceptions in Himself, as He conceived so He created: that is to say, He created an\u000aoutward form answerable to the inward conception or figure of His mind. In the second place, they\u000aought to know there is an universal patient, and this passive Nature was created by the Universal Agent.\u000aThis general patient is the immediate catholic character of God Himself in His Unity and trinity. In\u000aplain terms it is that substance which we commonly call the First Matter. But verily it is to no purpose\u000a*\u000a\u000aThomas Vaughan was born in Llansaintffraid on the banks of the Usk in 1621. His brother Henry\u000aVaughan the poet is rather better known than he is. This book was published for Thomas Vaughan in\u000a165o by H. Blunden at the Castle in Cornhill. Mr. A. E. Waite has produced an edition of all Vaughan's\u000awritings, including the present text, in one volume. Coelum Terrae is an excellent specimen of his work,\u000abesides being a very fine example of one kind of alchemical writing.\u000a\u000aPage 66\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000ato know this notion (or) Matter unless we know the thing itself to which the notion relates. We must see\u000ait, handle it and by experimental ocular demonstration know the very central invisible essences and\u000aproperties of it. But of these things hear the most excellent Capnion, who informs his Jew and his\u000aEpicure of two catholic natures - material and spiritual.\u000aOne nature (saith he) is such it may be seen with the eyes and felt with the hands, and it is\u000asubject to alteration almost in every moment. You must pardon - as Apuleius saith - this strange\u000aexpression, because it makes for the obscurity of the thing. This very nature - since she may not\u000acontinue one and the same - is notwithstanding apprehended of the mind under her such\u000aqualification more rightly as she is than as she is not, namely, as the thing itself is in truth - that is\u000ato say, changeable. The other nature or principle of substances is incorruptible, immutable,\u000aconstant, one and the same for ever, and always existent.\u000aThus he. Now, this changeable nature whereof he speaks is the first, visible, tangible substance that ever\u000aGod made: it is white in appearance and Paracelsus gives you the reason why: \u201cAll things,\u201d: saith he,\u000a\u201cwhen they first proceed from God are white, but He colours them afterwards according to His\u000apleasure.\u201d An example we have in this very matter, which the philosophers call sometimes their Red\u000aMagnesia, sometimes their white, by which descriptions they have deceived many men. For in the first\u000apreparation the chaos is blood-red, because the Central Sulphur is stirred up and discovered by the\u000aPhilosophical Fire. In the second it is exceeding. white and transparent like the heavens. It is in truth\u000asomewhat like common quicksilver, but of a celestial, transcendent brightness, for there is nothing upon\u000aearth like it. This fine substance is the child of the elements and it is a most pure sweet virgin, for\u000anothing as yet hath been generated out of her. But if at any time she breeds it is by the fire of Nature, for\u000athat is her husband. She is no animal, no vegetable, no mineral, neither is she extracted out of animals,\u000avegetables or minerals, but she is pre-existent to them all, for she is the mother of them. Yet one thing 1\u000amust say: she is not much short of life, for she is almost animal. Her composition is miraculous and\u000adifferent from all other compounds whatsoever. Gold is not so compact but every sophister concludes it\u000ais no simple; but she is so much one that no man believes she is more. She yields to nothing but love,\u000afor her end is generation and that was never yet performed by violence. He that knows how to wanton\u000aand toy with her, the same shall receive all her treasures. First, she sheds at her nipples a thick, heavy\u000awater, but white as any snow: the philosophers call it Virgin\u2019s Milk. Secondly, she gives him blood\u000afrom her very heart: it is a quick, heavenly fire; some improperly call it their sulphur. Thirdly and lastly,\u000ashe presents him with a secret crystal, of more worth and lustre than the white rock and all her rosials.\u000aThis is she, and these are her favours: catch her, if you can.\u000aTo this character and discovery of my own I shall add some more descriptions, as I find her limned\u000aand dressed by her other lovers. Some few - but such as knew her very well - have written that she is not\u000aonly one and three but withal four and five, and this truth is essential. The titles they have bestowed on\u000aher are diverse. They call her their Catholic Magnesia and the Sperm of the World out of which all\u000anatural things are generated. Her birth - say they - is singular and not without a miracle, her complexion\u000aheavenly and different from her parents. Her body also in some sense is incorruptible and the common\u000aelements cannot destroy it, neither will she mix with them essentially. In the outward shape or figure she\u000aresembles a stone and yet is no stone, for they call her their White Gum and Water of the Sea, Water of\u000aLife, Most Pure and Blessed Water; and yet they mind not water of the clouds or rain water, nor water\u000aof the well, nor dew, but a certain thick, permanent, saltish water, that is dry and wets not the hands, a\u000aviscous, slimy water generated out of the fatness of the earth. They call her also their twofold Mercury\u000aand Azoth, begotten by the influences of two globes, celestial and terrestrial. Moreover, they affirm her\u000ato be of that nature that no fire can destroy her, which of all other descriptions is most true, for she is\u000afire herself, having in her a portion of the universal fire of Nature and a secret celestial spirit, which\u000aspirit is animated and quickened by God Himself, wherefore also they call her their Most Blessed\u000aStone. Lastly, they say she is a middle nature between thick and thin, neither altogether earthy nor\u000aaltogether fiery but a mean aerial substance - to be found everywhere and every time of the year.\u000aThis is enough. But that I may speak something myself in plain terms, I say she is a very salt, but\u000aextreme soft and somewhat thin and fluid, not so hard, not so thick as common extracted salts, for she is\u000anone of them, nor any kind of salt whatsoever that man can make. She is a sperm that Nature herself\u000adraws out of the elements without the help of art. Man may find it where Nature leaves it; it is not of his\u000aoffice to make the sperm, nor to extract it. It is already made and wants nothing but a matrix and heat\u000aconvenient for generation. Now should you consider with yourselves where Nature leaves the seed, and\u000ayet many are so dull they know not how to work when they are told what they must do. We see in\u000aanimal generations the sperm parts not from both the parents, for it remains with the female, where it is\u000a\u000aPage 67\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aperfected. In the great world, though all the elements contribute to the composure of the sperm yet the\u000asperm parts not from all the elements but remains with the earth or with the water though more\u000aimmediately with the one than with the other. Let not your thoughts feed now on the phlegmatic,\u000aindigested vomits of Aristotle; look on the green, youthful and flowery bosom of the earth. Consider\u000awhat a vast universal receptacle this element is. The stars and planets overlook her and - though they\u000amay not descend hither themselves - they shed down their golden locks, like so many bracelets and\u000atokens of love. The sun is perpetually busy, brings his fire round about her, as if he would sublime\u000asomething from her bosom and rob her of some secret, enclosed jewel. Is there anything lost since the\u000acreation? Wouldst thou know his very bed and his pillow? It is earth. How many cities, dost thou think,\u000ahave perished with the sword? How many by earthquakes? And how many by the deluge? Thou dost\u000aperhaps desire to know where they are at this present: believe it, they have one common sepulchre.\u000aWhat was once their mother is now their tomb. All things return to that place from whence they came,\u000aand that very place is earth. If thou hast but leisure, run over the alphabet of Nature examine every letter\u000a- I mean every particular creature - in her book. What becomes of her grass, her corn, her herbs, her\u000aflowers? True it is, both man and beast do use them, but this only by the way, for they rest not till they\u000acome to earth again. In this element they had their first and in this will they have their last station. Think\u000a- if other vanities will give thee leave - on all those generations that went before thee and anticipate all\u000athose that shall come after thee. Where are those beauties the times past have produced and what will\u000abecome of those that shall appear in future ages? They will all to the same dust; they have one common\u000ahouse; and there is no family so numerous as that of the grave. Do but look on the daily sports of\u000aNature, her clouds and mists, the scene and pageantry of the air. Even these momentary things retreat to\u000athe closet of the earth. If the sun makes her dry she can drink as fast; what gets up in clouds comes\u000adown in water; the earth swallows up all and like that philosophical dragon eats her own tail. The wise\u000apoets saw this and in their mystical language called the earth Saturn, telling us withal she did feed on\u000aher own children. Verily, there is more truth in their stately verse than in Aristotle's dull prose, for he\u000awas a blind beast and malice made him so.\u000aBut to proceed a little further with you, I wish you to concoct what you read, to dwell a little upon\u000aearth, not to fly up presently and admire the meteors of your own brains. The earth, you know, in the\u000awinter-time is a dull, dark, dead thing - a contemptible, frozen, phlegmatic lump. But towards the spring\u000aand fomentations of the sun what rare pearls are there in this dung-hill, what glorious colours and\u000atinctures doth she discover! A pure, eternal green overspreads her, and this attended with innumerable\u000aother beauties - roses red and white, golden lilies, azure violets, the bleeding hyacinths, with their\u000aseveral celestial odours and spices. If you will be advised by me, learn from whence the earth hath these\u000ainvisible treasures, this annual flora, which appears not without the compliments of the sun. Behold, 1\u000awill tell you as plainly as I may. There are in the world two extremes - matter and spirit. One of these, I\u000acan assure you, is earth. The influences of the spirit animate and quicken the matter, and in the material\u000aextreme the seed of the spirit is to be found. In middle natures - as fire, air, and water - this seed stays\u000anot, for they are but dispenseros or media, which convey it from one extreme to the other, from the\u000aspirit to the matter-that is, the earth. But stay, my friend; this intelligence hath somewhat stirred you,\u000aand now you come on so furiously, as if you would rifle the cabinet. Give me leave to put you back. I\u000amind not this common, feculent, impure earth; that falls not within my discourse, but as it makes for\u000ayour manuduction. That which I speak of is a mystery: it is coelum terrae and terrae coeli, not this dirt\u000aand dust but a most secret, celestial, invisible earth.\u000aRaymund Lully, in his Compendium of Alchemy, calls the principles of art magic \u201ccertain fugitive\u000aspirits, condensed in the air, in the shape of divers monsters, beasts and men, which move like clouds\u000ahither and thither\u201d. As for the sense of our Spaniard, I refer it to his readers; let them make the most of\u000ait.\u000aThis is true; as the air and all the volatile substances in it are restless, even so is it with the First\u000aMatter. The eye of man never saw her twice under one and the same shape; but as clouds driven by the\u000awind are forced to this and that figure - but cannot possibly retain one constant form - so is she\u000apersecuted by the fire of Nature. For this fire and this water are like two lovers: they no sooner meet but\u000apresently they play and toy, and this game will not over till some new baby is generated. I have\u000aoftentimes admired their subtle perpetual motion, for at all times and in all places these two are busy,\u000awhich occasioned that notable sentence of Trismegistus', that action was the life of God. But most\u000aexcellent and magisterial is that oracle of Marcus Antoninus, who in his discourse to himself speaks\u000aindeed things worthy of himself. \u201cThe nature,\u201d saith he, \u201cof the universe delights not in anything so\u000amuch as to alter all things and then to make the like again.\u201d This is her tick-tack: she plays one game, to\u000abegin another. The Matter is placed before her like a piece of wax, and she shapes it to all forms and\u000afigures. Now she makes a bird, now a beast, now a flower, then a frog, and she is pleased with her own\u000a\u000aPage 68\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000amagical performances as men are with their own fancies. Hence she is called of Orpheus \u201cthe mother\u000athat makes many things and ordains strange shapes or figures\u201d. Neither doth she as some sinful parents\u000ado, who - having their pleasure - care not for their child. She loves them still after she hath made them,\u000ahath an eye over them all and provides even for her sparrows. \u2018Tis strange to consider that she works as\u000awell privately as publicly, not only in gardens, where ladies may smell her perfumes, but in remote\u000asolitudes and deserts. The truth is she seeks not to please others so much as herself, wherefore many of\u000aher works - and those the choicest - never come to light.\u000aWe see little children, who are newly come from under her hand, will be dabbling in dirt and water,\u000aand other idle sports affected by none but themselves. The reason is they are not as yet captivated,\u000awhich makes them seek their own pleasures. But when they come to age then love or profit makes them\u000asquare their actions according to other men's desires. Some cockney claps his revenue on his back, but\u000ahis gallantry is spoiled if his mistress doth not observe it. Another fights, but his victory is lost if it be\u000anot printed; it is the world must hear of his valour. Now, Nature is a free spirit that seeks no applause;\u000ashe observes none more than herself but is pleased with her own magic, as philosophers are with their\u000asecret philosophy. Hence it is that we find her busy not only in the pots of the balconies but in\u000awildernesses and ruinous places, where no eyes observe her but the stars and planets. In a word,\u000awheresoever the fire of Nature finds the Virgin Mercury there hath he found his love, and there will\u000athey both fall to their husbandry, a pleasure not subject to surfeits, for it still presents new varieties.\u000aIt is reported of Mark Antony, a famous but unfortunate Roman, how he sent his agent over the\u000aworld to copy all the handsome faces, that amongst so many excellent features he might select for\u000ahimself the most pleasing piece. Truly Nature is much of this strain, for she hath infinite beauteous\u000apatterns in herself, and all these she would gladly see beyond herself, which she cannot do without the\u000aMatter - for that is her glass. This makes her generate perpetually and imprint her conceptions in the\u000aMatter, communicating life to it and figuring it according to her imagination. By this practice she\u000aplaceth her fancy or idea beyond herself, or, as the Peripatetics say, beyond the Divine Mind, namely, in\u000athe Matter. But the ideas being innumerable and withal different, the pleasures of the agent are\u000amaintained by their variety or - to speak more properly - by his own fruitfulness, for amongst all the\u000abeauties the world affords there are not two that are altogether the same.\u000aMuch might be spoken in this place concerning beauty, what it is, from whence it came, and how it\u000amay be defaced. not only in the outward figure but in the inward idea and lost for ever in both worlds.\u000aBut these pretty shuttles 1 am no way acquainted with: I have no mistress but Nature, wherefore I shall\u000aleave the fine ladies to fine lads and speak of my simple\u000aAElia Laelia\u000aIt was scarce day when all alone\u000aI saw Hyanthe and her throne.\u000aIn fresh green darnask she was dressed\u000aAnd o'er a sapphire globe did rest.\u000aThis slippery sphere when I did see,\u000aFortune, I thought it had been thee.\u000aBut when 1 saw-she did present\u000aA majesty more permanent\u000aI thought my cares not lost if I\u000aShould finish my discovery.\u000aSleepy she look'd to my first sight,\u000aAs if she had watch'd all the night,\u000aAnd underneath her hand was spread\u000aThe white supporter of her head.\u000aBut at my second, studied view\u000aI could perceive a silent dew\u000aSteal down her cheeks, lest it should stain\u000aThose cheeks where only smiles should reign.\u000aThe tears stream'd down for haste and all\u000aIn chains of liquid pearl did fall.\u000aFair sorrows - and more dear than joys,\u000aWhich are but empty airs and noise Your drops present a richer prize,\u000a\u000aPage 69\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aFor they are something like her eyes.\u000aPretty white fool, why hast thou been\u000aSullied with tears and. not with sin?\u000a'Tis true thy tears, like polished skies,\u000aAre the bright rosials of thy eyes;\u000aBut such strange fates do them attend\u000aAs if thy woes would never end.\u000aFrom drops to sighs they turn and then\u000aThose sighs return to drops again\u000aBut whites the silver torrent seeks\u000aThose flowers that watch it in thy cheeks\u000aThe white and red Hyanthe wears\u000aTurn to rose-water all her tears.\u000aHave you beheld a flame that springs\u000aFrom incense when sweet curled rings\u000aOf smoke attend her last weak fires,\u000aAnd she all in perfumes expires?\u000aSo did Hyanthe. Here - said she Let not this vial part from thee.\u000aIt holds my heart, though now 'tis spill'd\u000aAnd into waters all distill'd.\u000a'Tis constant still. Trust not false smiles:\u000aWho smiles and weeps not she beguiles.\u000aNay, trust not tears: false are the few;\u000aThose tears are many that are true.\u000aTrust me and take the better choice:\u000aWho hath my tears can want no joys.\u000aI know some sophisters of the Heptarchy - I mean those whose learning is all noise, in which sense\u000aeven pyannets and paraquitoes are philosophical - will conclude this all bait and poetry; that we are\u000apleasing, not positive, and cheat even the reader's discretion. To prevent such impotent calumnies, and\u000ato spend a little more of our secret light upon the well-disposed student, I shall in this place produce the\u000atestimonies of some able philosophers concerning the First Matter itself, as it is naturally found before\u000aany alteration by art. And here verily the reader may discover the mark. It is most easily done, if he will\u000abut eve the flights of my verse or follow the more grave pace of their prose. The first I shall cite is\u000aArnoldus de Nova, an absolute perfect master of the Art. He describes the Philosophical Chaos in these\u000aplain terms:\u000aIt is (saith he) a stone and no stone, spirit, soul, and body; which if thou dissolvest, it will be\u000adissolved; and if thou dost coagulate it, it will be coagulated; and if thou dost make it fly, it will fly;\u000afor it is volatile or flying and clear as a tear. Afterwards it is made citrine, then saltish; but without\u000ashoots or crystals, and no man may touch it with his tongue. Behold, I have described it truly to\u000athee, but I have not named it. Now I will name it; and I say that if thou sayest it is water thou dost\u000asay the truth; and if thou sayest it is not water thou dost lie. Be not therefore deceived with\u000amanifold descriptions and operations, for it is but one thing, to which nothing extraneous may be\u000aadded.\u000aThus Arnoldus, and he borrowed this from the Turba. Let us now hear his disciple Raymund Lully,\u000awho, speaking very enviously and obscurely of seven metallic principles, describes the third - wherein\u000afour of the seven are included - in these words. Saith he:\u000aThe third principle is a clear, compounded water, and it is the next substance in complexion to\u000aquicksilver. It is found running and flowing upon the earth. This quicksilver is generated in every\u000acompound out of the substance of the air, and therefore the moisture of it is extreme heavy.\u000a\u000aPage 70\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aTo these I will add Albertus Magnus, whose suffrage in this kind of learning is like the stylanx to\u000agold, for he had thoroughly searched it and knew very well what part of it would abide the test. In plain\u000aEnglish saith he\u000aThe Mercury of the wise men is a watery element cold and moist. This is their Permanent\u000aWater, the spirit of the body, the unctuous vapour, the blessed water, the virtuous water, the water\u000aof the wise men, the philosopher's vinegar, the mineral water, the dew of heavenly grace. the\u000avirgin's milk, the bodily Mercury; and with other numberless names is it named in the books of the\u000aphilosophers; which names truly - though they are divers notwithstanding - always signify one and\u000athe same thing, namely, the Mercury of the wise men. Out of this Mercury alone all the virtue of the\u000aArt is extracted and - according to its nature - the Tincture, both red and white.\u000aTo this agrees Rachaidibi, the Persian. \u201cThe sperm or First Matter,\u201d saith he, \u2018of the stone is\u000aoutwardly cold and moist but inwardly hot and dry.\u201d All which is confirmed by Rhodian, another\u000ainstructor, it seems, of Kanid. King of Persia. His words are these:\u000aThe sperm is white and liquid, afterwards red. This sperm is the Flying Stone, and it is aerial\u000aand volatile, cold and moist., hot and dry.\u000aTo these subscribes the author of that excellent tract entitled The Book o the Three Words.\u000aThis (saith he) is the Book of Three Words, meaning thereby Three Principles; the Book of\u000athe Precious Stone, which is a body aerial and volatile, cold and moist, watery and adustive; and in\u000ait is heat and drought, coldness and moisture, one virtue inwardly, the other outwardly.\u000aBelus the philosopher, in that famous and most classic Synod of Arisleus, inverts the order to\u000aconceal the practice; but if rightly understood he speaks to the same purpose.\u000aAmongst all great philosophers (saith he) it is magisterial that our Stone is no stone; but\u000aamongst ignorants it is ridiculous and incredible. For who will believe that water can be made a\u000astone and a stone water, nothing being more different than these two? And yet in very truth it is so.\u000aFor this very Permanent Water is the Stone; but whiles it is water it is no stone.\u000aBut in this sense the ancient Hermes abounds and almost discovers too much.\u000aKnow (saith he), you that are children of the wise: the separation of the ancient philosophers\u000awas performed upon water, which separation divides the water into four other substances.\u000aThere is extant a very learned author who hath written something to this purpose, and that more\u000aopenly than any whom we have formerly cited.\u000aAs the world (saith he) was generated out of that Water upon which the Spirit of God did\u000amove, all things proceeding thence, both celestial and terrestrial, so this chaos is generated out of a\u000acertain Water that is not common. not out of dew nor air condensed in the caverns of the earth, or\u000aartificially in the receiver; not out of water drawn out of the sea, fountains, pits, or rivers; but out of\u000aa certain tortured water that hath suffered some alteration. Obvious it is to all but known to very\u000afew. This water hath all in it that is necessary to the perfection of the work, without any extrinsical\u000aaddition.\u000a1 could produce a thousand authors more, but that were tedious. I shall conclude with one of the\u000aRosy Brothers, whose testimony is equivalent to the best of these, but his instruction far more excellent.\u000aHis discourse of the First Matter is somewhat large, and to avoid proflixity I shall forbear the Latin, but\u000aI will give thee his sense in punctual, plain English.\u000aI am a goddess (saith he, speaking in the person of Nature), for beauty and extraction famous, born\u000aout of our own proper sea which compasseth the whole earth and is ever restless. Out ofmy breasts I\u000apour forth milk and blood: boil these two till they are turned into silver and gold. O most excellent\u000asubject, out of which all things in this world are generated, though at the first sight thou art poison,\u000aadorned with the name of the Flying Eagle. Thou are the First Matter, the seed of Divine Benediction,\u000a\u000aPage 71\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000ain whose body there is heat and rain, which notwithstanding are hidden from the wicked, because of thy\u000ahabit and virgin vestures which are scattered over all the world. Thy parents are the sun and moon; in\u000athee there is water and wine, gold also and silver upon earth, that mortal man may rejoice. After this\u000amanner God sends us His blessing and wisdom with rain and the beams of-the sun, to the eternal glory\u000aof His Name. But consider, O man. what things God bestows upon thee by this means. Torture the\u000aEagle till she weeps and the Lion be weakened and bleed to death. The blood of this Lion, incorporated\u000awith the tears of the Eagle, is the treasure of the earth. These creatures use to devour and kill one\u000aanother, but notwithstanding their love is mutual, and they put on the property and nature of a\u000aSalamander, which if it remains in the fire without any detriment it cures all the diseases of men.,\u000abeasts, and metals. After that the ancient philosophers had perfectly understood this subject they\u000adiligently sought in this middlemost tree in the Terrestrial Paradise, entering in by five litigious gates.\u000aThe first gate was the knowledge of the True Matter, and here arose the first and that a most bitter\u000aconflict. The second was the preparation by which this Matter was to be prepared, that they might\u000aobtain the embers of the Eagle and the blood of the Lion. At this gate there is a most sharp fight, for it\u000aproduceth water and blood and a spiritual, bright body. The third gate is the fire which conduceth to the\u000amaturity of the Medicine. The fourth gate is that of multiplication and augmentation, in which\u000aproportions and weight are necessary. The fifth and last gate is projection. But most glorious, full rich\u000aand high is he who attains, to the fourth gate, for he hath got an universal Medicine for all diseases. This\u000ais that great character of the Book of Nature out of which her whole alphabet doth arise. The fifth gate\u000aserves only for metals. This mystery, existing from the foundation of the world and the creation of\u000aAdam, is of all others the most ancient, a knowledge which God Almighty - by His Word - breathed\u000ainto Nature, a miraculous power, the blessed fire of life, the transparent carbuncle and red gold of the\u000awise men, and the Divine Benediction of this life. But this mystery, because of the malice and\u000awickedness of men, is given only to few, notwithstanding it lives and moves every day in the sight of\u000athe whole world, as it appears by the following parable.\u000aI am a poisonous dragon, present everywhere and to be had for nothing. My water and my fire\u000adissolve and compound. Out of my body thou shalt draw the Green and the Red Lion; but if thou dost\u000anot exactly know me thou wilt - with my fire - destroy thy five senses. A most pernicious, quick poison\u000acomes out of my nostrils which hath been the destruction of many. Separate therefore the thick from the\u000athin artificially, unless thou dost delight in extreme poverty. I give thee faculties both male and female\u000aand the powers both of heaven and earth. The mysteries of my art are to be performed magnanimously\u000aand with great courage if thou wouldst have me overcome the violence of the fire, in which attempt\u000amany have lost both their labour and their substance. I am the egg of Nature known only to the wise\u000asuch as are pious and modest, who make of me a little world. Ordained I was by the Almighty God for\u000amen, but - though many desire me - I am given only to few that they may relieve the poor with my\u000atreasures and not set their minds on gold that perisheth. I am called of the philosophers Mercury: my\u000ahusband is gold philosophical. I am the old dragon that is present everywhere on the face of the earth. I\u000aam father and mother, youthful and ancient, weak and yet most strong, life and death, visible and\u000ainvisible, hard and soft, descending to the earth and ascending to the heavens, most high and most low,\u000alight and heavy. In me the order of Nature is oftentimes inverted - in colour, number, weight, and\u000ameasure. I have in me the light of Nature; I am dark and bright; I spring from the earth and I come out\u000aof heaven; I am well known and yet a mere nothing; all colours shine in me and all metals by the beams\u000aof the sun. I am the Carbuncle of the Sun, a most noble, clarified earth, by which thou mayst turn\u000acopper, iron, tin, and lead into most pure gold.\u000aNow, gentlemen, you may see which way the philosophers move: they commend their Secret Water\u000aand I admire the tears of Hyanthe. There is something in the fancy besides poetry, for my mistress is\u000avery philosophical and in her love a pure platonic. But now I think upon it, how many rivals shall I\u000aprocure by this discourse? Every reader will fall to and some fine thing may break her heart with\u000anonsense. This love indeed were mere luck; but for my part I dare trust her, and lest any man should\u000amistake her for some things formerly named I will tell you truly what she is. She is not any known water\u000awhatsoever but a secret spermatic moisture, or rather the Venus that yields that moisture. Therefore do\u000anot you imagine that she is any crude, phlegmatic, thin water, for she is a fat, thick, heavy, slimy\u000ahumidity. But lest you should think I am grown jealous and would not trust you with my mistress,\u000aArnoldus de Villa Nova shall speak for me: hear him.\u000aI tell thee further (saith he) that we could not possibly find, neither could the philosophers find\u000abefore us, anything that would persist in the fire but only the unctuous humidity. A watery humidity\u000awe see will easily vapour away, and the earth remains behind, and the parts are therefore separated\u000a\u000aPage 72\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000abecause their composition is not natural. But if we consider those humidities which are hardly\u000aseparated from those parts which are natural to them, we find not any such but the unctuous,\u000aviscous humidities.\u000aIt will be expected perhaps by some flint and antimony doctors - who make their philosophical\u000acontrition with a hammer - that I should discover this thing outright and not suffer this strange bird-lime\u000ato hold their pride by the plumes. To these I say it is Water of Silver, which some have called Water of\u000athe Moon; but 'tis Mercury of the Sun, and partly of Saturn, for it is extracted from these three metals\u000aand without them it can never be made. Now they may unriddle and tell me what it is, for it is truth-if\u000athey can understand it.\u000aTo the ingenuous and modest reader I have something else to reply, and I believe it will sufficiently\u000aexcuse me. Raymund Lully - a man who had been in the centre of Nature and without all question\u000aunderstood a great part of the Divine Will - gives me a most terrible charge not to prostitute these\u000aprinciples. Saith he:\u000aI swear to thee upon my soul that thou art damned if thou shouldst reveal these things. For\u000aevery good thing proceeds from God and to Him only is due. Wherefore thou shalt reserve\u000aand keep that secret which God only should reveal, and thou shalt affirm thou dost justly keep\u000aback those things whose revelation belongs to His honour. For if thou shouldst reveal that in a\u000afew words which God hath been forming a long time, thou shouldst be condemned in the great\u000aday of judgment as a traitor to the majesty of God, neither should thy treason be forgiven thee.\u000aFor the revelation of such things belongs to God and not to man.\u000aSo said the wise Raymund.\u000aNow. for my part, I have always honoured the magicians, their philosophy being both rational and\u000amajestic, dwelling not upon notions but effects, and those such as confirm both the wisdom and the\u000apower of the Creator. When I was a mere errant in their books, and understood them not, I did believe\u000athem. Time rewarded my faith and paid my credulity with knowledge. In the interim I suffered many\u000abitter calumnies, and this by some envious adversaries who had nothing of a scholar but their gowns\u000aand a little language for vent to their nonsense. But these could not remove me; with a Spartan patience\u000aI concocted my injuries and found at last that Nature was magical, not peripatetical. I have no reason\u000athen to distrust them in spiritual things, whom I have found so orthodox and faithful even in natural\u000amysteries. I do believe Raymund, and in order to that faith I provide for my salvation. I will not\u000adiscover, that I may not be condemned. But if this will not satisfy thee - whoever thou art - let me\u000awhisper thee a word in the car, and afterwards do thou proclaim it on the housetop. Dost thou know\u000afrom whom and how that sperm or seed which men for want of a better name call the First Matter\u000aproceeded? A certain illuminatee - and in his days a member of that Society which some painted\u000abuzzards use to laugh at - writes thus:\u000aGod (saith he), incomparably good and great, out of nothing created something; but that\u000asomething was made one thing, in which all things were contained, creatures both celestial and\u000aterrestrial.\u000aThis first something was a certain kind of cloud or darkness, which was condensed in-to water, and\u000athis water is that one thing in which all things were contained. But my question is: What was that\u000anothing out of which the first cloudy chaos or something was made? Canst thou tell me? It may be thou\u000adost think it is a mere nothing. It is indeed nihil quo ad nos - nothing that we perfectly know. It is\u000anothing, as Dionysius saith: it is nothing that was created or of those things that are and nothing of that\u000awhich thou dost call nothing-that is, of those things that are not, in thy empty, destructive sense.\u000aBut, by your leave, it is the True Thing, of Whom we can affirm nothing. It is that Transcendent\u000aEssence Whose theology is negative and was known to the primitive Church but is lost in these our\u000adays. This is that nothing of Cornelius Agrippa, and in this nothing when he was tired with human\u000athings - -I mean human sciences - he did at last rest. \u201cTo know nothing is the happiest life.\u201d True\u000aindeed, for to know this nothing is life eternal. Learn, then, to understand that magical axiom \u201cthe\u000avisible was formed from the invisible\u201d, for all visibles came out of the invisible God, for He is the wellspring whence all things flow, and the creation was a certain stupendous birth or delivery. This fine\u000aVirgin Water, or chaos, was the Second Nature from God Himself and - if I may say so - the child of the\u000aBlessed Trinity. What doctor, then, is he whose hands are fit to touch that subject upon which God\u000aHimself, when He works, lays His own Spirit? For verily so we read: \u201cThe Spirit of God moved upon\u000a\u000aPage 73\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000athe face of the water.\u201d And can it be expected, then, that I should prostitute this mystery to all hands\u000awhatsoever, that I should proclaim it and cry it as they cry oysters? Verily these considerations, with\u000asome other which I will not for all the world put to paper, have made me almost displease my dearest\u000afriends, to whom, notwithstanding, I owe a better satisfaction. Had it been my fortune barely to know\u000athis Matter, as most men do, I had perhaps been less careful of it; but I have been instructed in all the\u000asecret circumstances thereof, which few upon earth understand. I speak not for any ostentation, but I\u000aspeak a truth which my conscience knows very well. Let me, then, Reader, request thy patience, for I\u000ashall leave this discovery to God, Who - if it be His blessed will - can call unto thee and say : Here it is\u000aand thus I work it.\u000aI had not spoken all this in my own defence had I not been assaulted - as it were - in this very point\u000aand told to my face I was bound to discover all that I knew, for this age looks for dreams and\u000arevelations as the train to their invisible righteousness. I have now sufficiently discoursed of the Matter,\u000aand if it be not thy fortune to find it by what is here written, yet thou canst not be deceived by what I\u000ahave said, for I have purposely avoided all those terms which might make thee mistake any common\u000asalts, stones, or minerals for it. I advise thee withal to beware of all vegetables and animals: avoid them\u000aand every part of them whatsoever. I speak this because some ignorant, sluttish broilers are of opinion\u000athat man's blood is the true subject. But, alas, is man's blood in the bowels of the earth, that metals\u000ashould be generated out of it? Or was the world and all that is therein made out of man's blood as of\u000atheir first matter? Surely no such thing. The First Matter was existent before man and all other creatures\u000awhatsoever, for she is the mother of them all. They were made of the First Matter, and not the First\u000aMatter of them. Take heed, then: let not any man deceive thee. It is totally impossible to reduce any\u000aparticular to the First Matter or to a sperm without our Mercury, and being so reduced it is not universal\u000abut the particular sperm of its own species, and works not any effects but what are agreeable to the\u000anature of that species: for God hath sealed it with a particular idea. Let them alone, then, who practise\u000aupon man's blood in their chemical stoves and athanors, or, as Sendivogius hath it, in fornaculis\u000amirabilibus. They will deplore their error at last and sit without sackcloth in the ashes of their\u000acompositions.\u000aBut I have done. I will now speak something of generation and the ways of it, that the process of\u000athe philosophers upon this matter may be the better understood. You must know that Nature hath two\u000aextremes and between them a middle substance, which elsewhere we have called the middle nature.\u000aExample enough we have in the creation. The first extreme was that cloud or darkness whereof we have\u000aspoken formerly. Some call it the remote matter and the invisible chaos, but very improperly, for it was\u000anot invisible. This is the Jewish Ain Soph outwardly, and it is the same with that Orphic night:\u000a\u201cO Night, thou black nurse of the golden stars.\u201d\u000aOut of this darkness all things that are in this world came, as out of their fountain or matrix. Hence\u000athat position of all famous poets and philosophers - that \u201call things were brought forth out of night\u201d.\u000aThe middle substance is the Water into which that night or darkness was condensed, and the creatures\u000aframed out of the water made up the other extreme. But the magicians, when they speak strictly, will not\u000aallow of this other extreme, because Nature does not stay here: wherefore their philosophy runs thus.\u000aMan - say they - in his natural state is in the mean creation, from which he must recede to one of two\u000aextremes - either to corruption, as commonly all men do, for they die and moulder away in their graves;\u000aor else to a spiritual, glorified condition, like Enoch and Elijah, who were translated. And this - they say\u000a- is a true extreme, for after it there is no alteration. Now, the magicians, reasoning with themselves why\u000athe mean creation should be subject to corruption, concluded the cause and original of this disease to be\u000ain the chaos itself, for even that was corrupted and cursed upon the Fall of man. But examining things\u000afurther they found that Nature in her generations did only concoct the chaos with a gentle heat. She did\u000anot separate the parts and purify each of them by itself; but the purities and impurities of the sperm\u000aremained together in all her productions, and this domestic enemy prevailing at last occasioned the\u000adeath of the compound. Hence they wisely gathered that to minister vegetables, animals or minerals for\u000aphysic was a mere madness, for even these also had their own impurities and diseases, and required\u000asome medicine to cleanse them. Upon this adviso they resolved - God without all question being their\u000aguide - to practise on the chaos itself. They opened it, purified it, united what they had formerly\u000aseparated and fed it with a twofold fire, thick and thin, till they brought it to the immortal extreme and\u000amade it a spiritual, heavenly body. This was their physic, this was their magic. In this performance they\u000asaw the image of that face which Zoroaster calls the pre-existent countenance of the Triad. They\u000aperfectly knew the Secundea which contains all things in her naturally, as God contains all things in\u000aHimself spiritually. They saw that the life of all things here below was a thick fire, or fire imprisoned\u000aand incorporated in a certain incombustible, aerial moisture. They found, moreover, that this moisture\u000a\u000aPage 74\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000awas originally derived from heaven and in this sense heaven is styled in the Oracles: \u201cFire, derivation of\u000afire and food of fire.\u201d\u000aIn a word, they saw with their eyes that Nature was male and female, as the Kabalists express it: a\u000acertain fire of a most deep red colour, working on a most white, heavy, salacious water, which water\u000aalso is fire inwardly, but outwardly very cold. By this practice it was manifested unto them that God\u000aHimself was Fire, according to that of Eximidius in Turba: \u201cThe beginning of all things,\u201d saith he, \u201cis a\u000acertain nature, and that eternal and infinite, cherishing and heating all things\u201d. The truth is, life - which\u000ais nothing else but light - proceeded originally from God and did apply to the chaos, which is elegantly\u000acalled by Zoroaster \u201cthe fountain of fountains and of all fountains, the matrix containing all things.\u201d We\u000asee by experience that all individuals live not only by their heat, but they are preserved by the outward\u000auniversal heat which is the life of the great world. Even so truly the great world itself lives not\u000aaltogether by that heat which God hath enclosed in the parts thereof, but it is preserved by the\u000acircumfused, influent heat of the Deity. For above the heavens God is manifested like an infinite\u000aburning world of light and fire, so that He overlooks all that He hath made and the whole fabric stands\u000ain His heat and light, as a man stands here on earth in the sunshine. I say then that the God of Nature\u000aemploys Himself in a perpetual coction, and this not only to generate but to preserve that which hath\u000abeen generated; for His spirit and heat coagulate that which is thin, rarefy that which is too gross,\u000aquicken the dead parts and cherish the cold. There is indeed one operation of heat whose method is vital\u000aand far more mysterious than the rest; they that have use for it must study it.\u000aI have for my part spoken all that I intend to speak, and though my book may prove fruitless to\u000amany, because not understood, yet some few may be of that spirit as to comprehend it. \u201cSpacious flame\u000aof spacious mind,\u201d said the great Chaldean. But because I will not leave thee without some satisfaction,\u000aI advise thee to take the Moon of the firmament, which is a middle nature, and place her so that every\u000apart of her may be in two elements at one and the same time. These elements also must equally attend\u000athe body, not one further off, not one nearer than the other. In the regulating of these two there is a\u000atwofold geometry to be observed - natural and artificial. But I may speak no more.\u000aThe true furnace is a little simple shell; thou mayst easily carry it in one of thy hands. The glass is\u000aone and no more; but some philosophers have used two, and so mayst thou. As for the work itself, it is\u000ano way troublesome; a lady may read the Arcadia and at the same time attend this philosophy without\u000adisturbing her fancy. For my part, I think women are fitter for it than men, for in such things they are\u000amore neat and patient, being used to a small chemistry of sack-possets and other finical sugar-sops.\u000aConcerning the effects of this medicine I shall not speak anything at this time. He that desires to know\u000athem let him read the Revelation of Paracelsus, a discourse altogether incomparable and in very truth\u000amiraculous. And here without any partiality I shall give my judgment of honest Hohenheim. I find in the\u000arest of his works. and especially where he falls on the Stone, a great many false processes, but his\u000adoctrine of it in general is very sound. The truth is he had some pride to the justice of his spleen, and in\u000amany places he hath erred of purpose, not caring what bones he threw before the schoolmen, for he was\u000aa pilot of Guadalcanar and sailed sometimes in his rio de la recriation.\u000aBut I had almost forgot to tell thee that which is all in all, and it is the greatest difficulty in all the\u000aart - namely, the fire. It is a close, airy, circular, bright fire: the philosophers call it their sun and the\u000aglass must stand in the shade. It makes not the Matter to vapour - no, not so much as to sweat. It digests\u000aonly with a still, piercing, vital heat. It is continual and therefore at last alters the chaos and corrupts it.\u000aThe proportion and regimen of it is very scrupulous, but the best rule to know it by is that of the Synod:\u000a\u2018Let not the bird fly before the fowler.\u201d Make it sit while you give fire, and then you are sure of your\u000aprey. For a close I must tell thee the philosophers call this fire their bath, but it is a bath of Nature, not\u000aan artificial one; for it is not any kind of water but a certain subtle, temperate moisture which\u000acompasseth the glass and feeds their sun or fire. In a word, without this bath nothing in the world is\u000agenerated. Now, that thou mayst the better understand what degree of fire is requisite for the work,\u000aconsider the generation of man, or any other creature whatsoever. It is not kitchen fire nor fever that\u000aworks upon the sperm in the womb, but a most temperate, moist, natural heat which proceeds from the\u000avery life of the mother. It is just so here. Our Matter is a most delicate substance and tender, like the\u000aanimal sperm, for it is almost a living thing. Nay, in very truth, it hath some small portion of life, for\u000aNature doth produce some animals out of it. For this very reason the least violence destroys it and\u000aprevents all generation; for if it be overheated but for some few minutes the white and red sulphurs will\u000anever essentially unite and coagulate. On the contrary, if it takes cold but for half an hour - the work\u000abeing once well begun - it will never sort to any good purpose. I speak out of my own experience, for I\u000ahave - as they phrase it - given myself a box on the ear, and that twice or thrice, out of a certain\u000aconfident negligence, expecting that which I knew well enough could never be.\u000a\u000aPage 75\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aNature moves not by the theory of men but by their practice, and surely wit and reason can perform\u000ano miracles unless the hands supply them. Be sure then to know this fire in the first place, and\u000aaccordingly be sure to make use of it. But for thy better security I will describe it to thee once more. It\u000ais a dry, vaporous, humid fire; it goes round about the glass and is both equal and continual. It is\u000arestless, and some have called it the white philosophical coal. It is in itself natural, but the preparation\u000aof it is artificial. It is a heat of the dead, wherefore some call it their unnatural, necromantic fire. It is no\u000apart of the matter, neither is it taken out of it; but it is an external fire and serves only to stir up and\u000astrengthen the inward oppressed fire of the chaos. But let us hear Nature herself, for thus she speaks in\u000athe serious romance of Mehung.\u000aAfter putrefaction succeeds generation and that because of the inward, incombustible Sulphur that\u000aheats or thickens the coldness and crudities of the Quicksilver, which suffers so much thereby that\u000aat last it is united to the Sulphur and made one body therewith. All this - namely, fire, air, and water\u000a- is contained in one vessel. In their earthly vessel - that is, in their gross body or composition - I\u000atake them, and then I leave them in one alembic, where I concoct, dissolve and sublime them\u000awithout the help of hammer, tongs or fire; without coals, smoke, fire or bath; or the alembics of the\u000asophisters. For I have my heavenly fire, which excites or stirs up the elemental one, according as\u000athe matter desires a becoming agreeable form.\u000aNow, Nature everywhere is one and the same, wherefore she reads the same lesson to Madathan,\u000awho, thinking in his ignorance to make the Stone without dissolution, receives from her this check.\u000a\u2018Dost thou think,\u201d 23 says she, \u201cto cat oysters, shells and all? Ought they not first to be opened and\u000aprepared by the most ancient cook of the planets?\u201d With these agrees the excellent Flamel, who,\u000aspeaking of the solar and lunar Mercury - and the plantation of the one in the other, hath these words:\u000a\u201cTake them therefore,\u201d saith he, \u201cand cherish them over a fire in thy alembic. But it must not be a fire of\u000acoals, nor of any wood, but a bright shining fire, like the Sun itself, whose heat must never be excessive\u000abut always of one and the same degree.\u201d This is enough and too much, for the secret in itself is not great\u000abut the consequences of it are so-which made the philosophers hide it. Thus, Reader, thou hast the\u000aoutward agent most fully and faithfully described. It is in truth a very simple mystery and - if I should\u000atell it openly - ridiculous. Howsoever, by this and not without it did the magicians unlock the chaos; and\u000acertainly it is no news that an iron key should open a treasury of gold.\u000aIn this universal subject they found the natures of all particulars, and this is signified to us by that\u000amaxim: \u201cLet him who is not familiar with Proteus have recourse to Pan.\u201d This Pan is their chaos or\u000aMercury, which expounds Proteus - namely, the particular creatures, commonly called individuals. For\u000aPan transforms himself into a Proteus, that is, into all varieties of species, into animals, vegetables, and\u000aminerals. For out of the Universal Nature or First Matter all these are made and Pan hath their\u000aproperties in himself. Hence it is that Mercury is called the Interpreter or Expositor of inferiors and\u000asuperiors, under which notion the ancient Orpheus invokes him: \u201cHear me, O Mercury, thou messenger\u000aof Jove and son of Maia. the Expositor of all things.\u201d Now, for the birth of this Mercury and the place\u000aof it I find but few philosophers that mention it. Zoroaster points at it, and that very obscurely, where he\u000aspeaks of his Lynges or the Ideas in these words: \u201cTheir multitudes leap upward, ascending to those\u000ashining worlds wherein are the three heights, and beneath these there lies the chief pasture. This pratum\u000aor meadow of the Ideas, a place well known to the philosophers - Flamel calls it their garden and the\u000amountain of the seven metals; see his Summary, where he describes it most learnedly, for he was\u000ainstructed by a Jew - a certain secret but universal region. One calls it the Region of Light, but to the\u000aKabalist it is Night of the Body, a term extremely apposite and significant. It is in few words the\u000arendezvous of all spirits. for in this place the ideas - when they descend from the bright world to the\u000adark one - are incorporated. For thy better intelligence thou must know that spirits whiles they move in\u000aheaven, which is the fireworld, contract no impurities at all, according to that of Stellatus: \u201cAll,\u201d saith\u000ahe, \u201cthat is above the moon is eternal and good, and there is no corruption of heavenly things.\u201d On the\u000acontrary, when spirits descend to the elemental matrix and reside in her kingdom they are blurred with\u000athe original leprosy of the matter, for here the curse raves and rules; but in heaven it is not predominant.\u000aTo put an end to this point, let us hear the admirable Agrippa state it. This is he between whose lips the\u000atruth did breathe and knew no other oracle.\u000aThe heavenly powers or spiritual essences, whiles they are in themselves, or before they are united\u000ato the Matter and are showered down from the Father of Lights through the holy intelligences and\u000athe heavens, until they come to the moon - their influence is good, as in the first degree. But when it\u000ais received in a corrupt subject the influence also is corrupted.\u000a\u000aPage 76\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aThus he. Now, the astronomers pretend to a strange familiarity with the stars; the natural\u000aphilosophers talk as much; and truly an ignorant man might well think they had been in heaven and\u000aconversed - like Lucian's Menippus - with Jove himself. But in good earnest these men are no more\u000aeagles than Sancho; their fancies are like his flights in the blanket and every way as short of the skies.\u000aAsk them but where the influences are received and how; bid them by fair experience prove they are\u000apresent in the elements, and you have undone them. If you will trust the four corners of a figure or the\u000athree legs of a syllogism you may: this is all their evidence. Well fare the magicians, then, whose Art\u000acan demonstrate these things and put the very influences in our hands. Let it be thy study to know their\u000aRegion of Light and to enter into the treasures thereof, for then thou mayst converse with spirits and\u000aunderstand the nature of invisible things. Then will appear unto thee the universal subject and the two\u000amineral sperms - white and red, of which I must speak somewhat before I make an end.\u000aIn the PY'THAGORICAL SYNOD which consisted of three score and ten philosophers, all Masters\u000aof the Art, it is thus written:\u000aThe thickness or sperm of the fire falls into the air. The thickness or spermatic part of the air, and\u000ain it the sperm of the fire, falls into the water. The thickness or spermatic substance of the water\u000aand in it the two sperms of fire and air, fall into the earth. and there they rest and are conjoined.\u000aTherefore the earth itself is thicker than the other elements, as it openly appears and to the eye is\u000amanifest.\u000aRemember now what I have told thee formerly concerning the earth, what a general hospital it is,\u000ahow it receives all things, not only beasts and vegetables but proud and glorious man. When death hath\u000aruined him, his coarse parts stay here and know no other home. This earth to earth is just the doctrine of\u000athe Magi. Metals - say they - and all things may be reduced into that whereof they were made. They\u000aspeak the very truth: it is God's own principle and He first taught it Adam. \u201cDust thou art and unto dust\u000ashalt thou return.\u201d But lest any man should be deceived by us, I think it just to inform you there are two\u000areductions. One is violent and destructive, reducing bodies to their extremes; and properly it is death, or\u000athe calcination of the common chemist. The other is vital and generative, resolving bodies into their\u000asperm or middle substance, out of which Nature made them; for Nature makes not bodies immediately\u000aof the elements but of a sperm which she draws out of the elements. I shall explain myself to you by an\u000aexample. An ear is the sperm or middle substance out of which a chick is engendered, and the moisture\u000aof it is viscous and slimy, a water and no water, for such a sperm ought to be. Suppose Doctor Coal - I\u000amean some broiler - had a mind to generate something out of this egg: questionless, he would first distil\u000ait. and that with a fire able to roast the hen that laid it. Then would he calcine the caput mortuum and\u000afinally produce his nothing.\u000aHere you are to observe that bodies are nothing else but sperm coagulated, and he that destroys the\u000abody by consequence destroys the sperm. Now, to reduce bodies into elements of earth and water - as\u000awe have instanced in the egg - is to reduce them into extremes beyond their sperm, for elements are not\u000athe sperm but the sperm is a compound made of the elements and containing in itself all that is requisite\u000ato the frame of the body. Wherefore be well advised before you distil and quarter any particular bodies,\u000afor having once separated their elements you may never generate unless you can make a sperm of those\u000aelements. But that is impossible for man to do:; it is the power of God and Nature. Labour then, you that\u000awould be accounted wise, to find out our Mercury: so shall you reduce things to their mean spermatical\u000achaos. But avoid the broiling destruction. This doctrine will spare you the vain task of distillation, if\u000ayou will but remember this truth - that sperms are not made by separation but by composition of\u000aelements; and to bring a body into sperm is not to distil it but to reduce the whole into one thick water,\u000akeeping all the parts thereof in their first natural union.\u000aBut that I may return at last to my former citation of the Synod. All those influences of the elements\u000abeing united in one mass make our sperm or our earth - which is earth and no earth. Take it, if thou dost\u000aknow it, and divide the essences thereof, not by violence but by natural putrefaction, such as may\u000aoccasion a genuine dissolution of the compound. Here thou shalt find a miraculous White Water, an\u000ainfluence of the moon, which is the mother of our chaos. It rules in two clements - earth and water.\u000aAfter this appears the sperm or influx of the sun, which is the father of it. It is a quick celestial fire,\u000aincorporated in a thin, oleous, aerial moisture. It is incombustible, for it is fire itself and feeds upon fire;\u000aand the longer it stays in the fire the more glorious it grows. These are the two mineral sperms masculine and feminine. If thou dost place them both on their crystalline basis, thou hast the\u000aphilosopher's flying Fire-Drake, which at the first sight of the sun breathes such a poison that nothing\u000acan stand before him. I know not what to tell thee more unless - in the vogue of some authors - I should\u000a\u000aPage 77\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000agive thee a phlegmatic description of the whole process, and that I can despatch in two words. It is\u000anothing else but a continual coction, the volatile essences ascending and descending, till at last they are\u000afixed according to that excellent prosopopoeia of the Stone:\u000aI am not dead, although my spirit's gone,\u000aFor it returns, and is both off and on:\u000aNow I have life enough, now I have none.\u000aI suffer'd more than one could justly do;\u000aThree souls I had and all my own, but two\u000aAre fled: the third had almost left me too.\u000a\u201cWhat I have written, I have written.\u201d And now give me leave to look about me. Is there no powder-plot\u000aor practice?\u000aWhat is become of Aristotle and Galen? Where are the scribe and pharisee, the disputers of this\u000aworld? If they suffer all this and believe it too, I shall think the general conversion is come about, and I\u000amay sing:\u000aThe Virgin's sign returns, comes Saturn's reign.\u000aBut come what will come, I have once more spoken for the truth and shall for conclusion speak this\u000amuch again. 1 have elsewhere called this subject \u201ca celestial slime\u201d and the middle nature. The\u000aphilosophers call it the venerable nature; but amongst all the pretenders I have not yet found one that\u000acould tell me why. Hear me then, that whensoever thou dost attempt this work it may be with reverence\u000a- not like some proud, ignorant doctor, but with less confidence and more care. This chaos hath in it the\u000afour elements, which of themselves are contrary natures; but the wisdom of God hath so placed them\u000athat their very order reconciles them. For example, air and earth are adversaries; for one is hot and\u000amoist, the other cold and dry. Now to reconcile these two God placed the water between them, which is\u000aa middle nature, or of a mean complexion between both extremes. For she is cold and mois ; and as she\u000ais cold she partakes of the nature of the earth, which is cold and dry; but as she is moist she partakes of\u000athe nature of the air, which is hot and moist. Hence it is that air and earth, which are contraries in\u000athemselves, agree and embrace one another in the water, as in a middle nature which is proportionate to\u000athem both and tempers their extremities. But verify this salvo makes not up the breach, for though the\u000awater reconciles two elements like a friendly third, yet she herself fights with a fourth - namely, with the\u000afire. For the fire is hot and dry but the water is cold and moist, which are clear contraries. To prevent\u000athe distempers of these two God placed the air between them, which is a substance hot and moist; and\u000aas it is hot it agrees with the fire, which is hot and dry; but as it is moist it agrees with the water, which\u000ais cold and moist; so that by mediation of the air the other two extremes, namely, fire and water, are\u000amade friends and reconciled. Thus you see - as I told you at first - that contrary elements are united by\u000athat order and texture wherein the Wise God hath placed them.\u000aYou must now give me leave to tell you that this agreement or friendship is but partial - a very\u000aweak love, cold and skittish. For whereas these principles agree in one quality thev differ in two, as\u000ayour selves may easily compute. Much need therefore have they of a more strong and able mediator to\u000aconfirm and preserve their weak unity; for upon it depends the very eternity and incorruption of the\u000acreature. This blessed cement and balsam is the Spirit of the Living God, which some ignorant\u000ascribblers have called a quintessence. For this very Spirit is in the chaos and to speak plainly the fire is\u000aHis throne, for in the fire He is seated. as we have sufficiently told you elsewhere. This was the reason\u000awhy the Magi called the First Matter their Venerable Nature and their Blessed Stone. And in good\u000aearnest, what think you? Is it not so? This Blessed Spirit fortifies and perfects that weak disposition\u000awhich the elements already have to union and peace - for God works with Nature, not against her - and\u000abrings them at last to a beauteous specifical fabric.\u000aNow if you will ask me where is the soul or-as the school - men abuse her - the form all this while?\u000aWhat doth she do? To this I answer that she is, as all instrumentals ought to be subject and obedient to\u000athe will of God, expecting the perfection of her body. For it is God that unites her to the body and the\u000abody to her. Soul and body are the work of God - the one as well as the other. The soul is not the\u000aartificer of her house, for that which can make a body can also repair it and hinder death; but the soul\u000acannot do this; it is the power and wisdom of God. In a word, to say that the soul formed the body\u000abecause she is in the body is to say that the jewel made the cabinet because the jewel is in the cabinet;\u000a\u000aPage 78\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aor that the sun made the world because the sun is in the world and cherisheth every part thereof. Learn\u000atherefore to distinguish between agents and their instruments, for if you attribute that to the creature\u000awhich belongs to the Creator you bring yourselves in danger of hell-fire. For God is a jealous God and\u000awill not give His glory to another. I advise my doctors therefore, both divines and physicians, not to be\u000atoo rash in their censures, nor so magisterial in their discourse as I have known some professors of\u000aphysic to be - who would correct and undervalue the rest of their brethren when in truth they themselves\u000awere most shamefully ignorant. It is not ten or twelve years\u2019 experience in drugs and sops can acquaint\u000aa man with the mysteries of God's creation. \u201cTake this and make a world\u201d - \u201cTake I know not what and\u000amake a pill or clyster\u201d - are different receipts. We should therefore consult with our judgments before\u000awe venture our tongues and never speak but when we are sure we understand.\u000aI knew a gentleman who, meeting with a philosopher adept, and receiving so much courtesy as to\u000abe admitted to discourse, attended his first instructions passing well. But when this magician quitted my\u000afriend's known road and began to touch and drive round the great wheel of Nature, presently my\u000agentleman takes up the cudgels, and, urging all the authorities which in his vain judgment made for him,\u000aoppressed this noble philosopher with a most clamorous, insipid ribaldry. A goodly sight it was and\u000aworthy our imitation to see with what an admirable patience the other received him. But this errant\u000aconcluded at last that lead or quicksilver must be the subject and that Nature worked upon one or both.\u000aTo this the Adeptus replied: \u201cSir, it may be so at this time, but if hereafter I find Nature in those old\u000aelements where I have sometimes seen her very busy, I shall at our next meeting confute your opinion.\u201d\u000aThis was all he said and it was something more than he did. Their next meeting was referred to the\u000aGreek Kalends, for he could never be seen afterwards, notwithstanding a thousand solicitations.\u000aSuch talkative, babbling people as this gentleman was, who run to every doctor for his opinion and\u000afollow like a spaniel every bird they spring, are not fit to receive these secrets. They must be serious,\u000asilent men, faithful to the Art and most faithful to their teachers. We should always remember that\u000adoctrine of Zeno: \u201cNature,\u201d said he, \u201cgave us one tongue but two ears., that we might hear much and\u000aspeak little.\u201d Let not any man therefore be ready to vomit forth his own shame and ignorance. Let him\u000afirst examine his knowledge and especially his practice, lest upon the experience of a few violent\u000aknacks he presume to judge Nature in her very sobrieties.\u000aTo make an end: if thou dost know the First Matter, know also for certain thou hast discovered the\u000aSanctuary of Nature. There is nothing between thee and her treasures but the door. That indeed must be\u000aopened. Now if thy desire leads thee on to the practice, consider well with thyself what manner of man\u000athou art and what it is that thou wouldst do; for it is no small matter. Thou hast resolved with thyself to\u000abe a co-operator with the Spirit of the Living God and to minister to Him in His work of generation.\u000aHave a care therefore that thou dost not hinder His work; for if thy heat exceeds the natural proportion\u000athou hast stirred the wrath of the moist natures and they will stand up against the central fire, and the\u000acentral fire against them; and there will be a terrible division in the chaos. But the sweet Spirit of Peace,\u000athe true eternal quintessence, will depart from the elements, leaving both them and thee to confusion.\u000aNeither will he apply Himself to that Matter as long as it is in thy violent, destroying hands. Take heed\u000atherefore lest thou turn partner with the devil, for it is the devil's design from the beginning of the world\u000ato set Nature at variance with herself that he may totally corrupt and destroy her. \u201cDo not thou further\u000ahis designs.\u201d I make no question but many men will laugh at this; but on my soul I speak nothing but\u000awhat 1 have known by very good experience: therefore believe me. For my own part, it was ever my\u000adesire to bury these things in silence, or to paint them out in shadows. But I have spoken thus clearly\u000aand openly out of affection I bear to some who have deserved much more at my hands. True it is I\u000aintended sometimes to expose a greater work to the world which I promised in my Anthroposophia; but\u000aI have been since acquainted with that world and I found it base and unworthy; wherefore I shall keep in\u000amy first happy solitudes, for noise is nothing to me. I seek not any man's applause. If it be the will of my\u000aGod to call me forth and that it may make for the honour of His Name, in that respect I may write again;\u000afor I fear not the judgment of man. But in the interim, here shall be an end.\u000aFINIS\u000a\u000aPage 79\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aCONCLUSION\u000aWhereas the former two texts of this book have dealt principally with the obscure practice of the\u000aalchemical art, this text of Vaughan also includes certain of the Philosophical and mystical notions\u000apeculiar to the alchemists. As I have earlier suggested, the basis of the entire scheme is rooted in that\u000asystem which is called the Qabalah - something of which I attempted to expound on a previous page,\u000aand also at some length in other of my books. This assumption is confirmed by Vaughan himself. The\u000aentirety of this book Coelum Terrae is based upon Qabalistic implicits. For example, on the second\u000apage of the book he says, quoting one of the Qabalistic authorities, that \u201cthe building of the sanctuary\u000awhich is here below is framed according to that of the sanctuary which is above\u2019. This is simply a\u000arepetition, of course, rather simlilar to the other Hermetic one that \u2018that which is above is like unto that\u000awhich is below\u201d, and vice versa.\u000aIt was upon that philosophical foundation that the alchemists reared their art. Taking the first few\u000alines of Genesis as their guide, they sought to duplicate that vast creative process in the lesser world of\u000aman\u2019s own nature. \u201cThe spirit of God hovered over the great waters of creation.\u201d So also the production\u000aof the Philosopher\u2019s Stone was imagined to be a process not too dissimilar to the creation of the\u000auniverse. For whatever powers and forces their philosophy posited as existent in the macrocosm, in the\u000auniverse, just those forces were mirrored and so were operative in the microcosm that was man. The\u000aalchemists sought to perform a re-creation in man that was comparable to what, in the vast periods of\u000adistant time, God had done with the universe. They sought a differentiation of the myriad elements of\u000athe human personality so that the inward spirit could be rendered independent in consciousness of the\u000aphysical frame. Being thus separated from its vehicle, that spirit could by its own innate divine power\u000again complete control of that vehicle and rebuild it in very much the same way as the waters of creation\u000awere manipulated and made subject to the original creative fiat.\u000aHerein, Vaughan embarks upon a lengthy description of what in the first book of the Bible is called\u000a\u201cthe waters of creation\u201d. Other alchemists at other times have given it different names. They named it\u000aVirgin\u2019s Milk, the Water of the Wise, Azoth, Mercury, and the First Material. But few, possibly, have\u000adescribed it half as eloquently and suggestively as has Vaughan. He personalizes the entire concept in a\u000avery poetic way, speaking of her as a \u201cpure sweet virgin\u201d. In so far as he gives a description of her,\u000astating that \u201cshe yields to nothing but love and her end is generation\u201d, we at once are enabled to\u000aassociate the idea with concepts inhering in our own philosophical scheme of things. First of all, we are\u000aable to identify her with what in the Qabalah is called the Sephirah named Binah, who, in a cosmic\u000asense, is described as being the Great Mother of all. Another of her attributions is the Great Sea, that\u000apassive plastic base over which the Spirit of Life originally hovered. Because of the synthetic nature of\u000athe Qabalistic Tree of Life, we are able also to place other ideas in juxtaposition with this one. Hence\u000awhen Vaughan speaks of an active and a passive agent in Nature, identifying this Pure Virgin whose\u000anature is love with the passive First Material who is our Qabalistic Great Mother, we are able to assume\u000athat the active agent is what the Zoharists speak of as Chokmah, the Father. His nature is Wisdom,\u000aPower, and Ideation.\u000aThese are broad concepts which exist on a cosmic universal plane - generalizations recapitulating\u000athemselves as particulars within the lesser human cycle. Following the aphorism that Vaughan uses as\u000athe beginning, that the lesser sanctuary is builded on the same pattern as the greater sanctuary above, we\u000amay assume therefore that these principles likewise inhere within every human being. Thus the two\u000aagents, passive and active, are part and parcel of each individual\u2019s psycho-spiritual constitution.\u000aHis statement that he has experimentally handled the First Material in itself is not the strange\u000afantastic thing !hat it might at first sight have seemed. It is not, because, in a word, you and 1 and\u000aeverybody else in this world has done precisely the same. The only difference is that some have realized\u000atheir own true natures consciously. Others are in ignorance of it. This statement of Vaughan\u2019s, and this\u000ainterpretation, imputes a very high philosophical level to Alchemy. It is clear from our author that it\u000awould be ridiculous to interpret Alchemy in a physical, metallurgical manner.\u000aQuite early in his book he says that there are in this world two extremes - Spirit and Matter. He also\u000aproceeds to state that in the middle natures such as fire, air, and water the seed of the spirit is not\u000aconstant. Like all occult philosophy, the Qabalah speaks at great length of these elements of earth, air,\u000awater, and fire. Many are the ways in which we can interpret them. Most commonly held, however, is\u000athe view that fire is mind, water emotion, air the vital life energy, and earth the body in which all of\u000athese forces operate. Above them, and acting through them, is the Spirit. Other thinkers, however,\u000aprefer to consider the elements as so many levels or strata of what is known in this day and age as the\u000aUnconscious. Vaughan\u2019s idea is that the middle natures of fire, air, and water are only the media which\u000a\u000aPage 80\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aconvey that vital spirit from one extreme to the other - from the heights to the depths. It is also added\u000athat in the material extreme the seed of the Spirit is to be found. To that sentence Mrs. Atwood has\u000aadded an additional clause: \u201cin the material extreme, when it is purified, the seed of the spirit is to be\u000afound\u201d. The implication is that Alchemy is a technical process of extracting the seed of the spirit from\u000athe gross body in which it has been imprisoned for countless ages. After this separation the seed can be\u000asubjected to warmth and light and stimulated into further growth, so that it can begin to exert its own\u000adivine nature and power by the reformulation of the vehicles through which it must act. Therefore the\u000abuilding up or the concoction of the Philosopher\u2019s Stone is nothing more nor less than consciously\u000areorganizing the material with which one has to deal in life. Reconstructing it in such a way that it really\u000ashows forth and manifests the splendour and glory of the ineffable spirit that dwells always in its own\u000aabiding city within.\u000aLike all other alchemists, Vaughan too lays great stress on that secret fire which is to encompass\u000athat differentiation. It is by means of fire that the spirit separates itself from the body in which it has\u000abeen bound and by which it has been blinded. By means of fire the new personality may be built up in\u000aconformity with the wishes and dictates of the spirit. In the Chinese text The Secret of the Golden\u000aFlower we read: \u201cThe spirit is thought; thought is the heart;- the heart is the fire; the fire is the Elixir.\u201d\u000aAgain it seems incredible that there could be individuals who were so blind to the intrinsic evidence of\u000aalchemical writing as to believe the alchemists worked with metals and with furnaces and with coals.\u000aFor what says Vaughan here? Speaking of this fire, he says, \u201cIt is not kitchen fire nor fever that works\u000aupon the sperm in the womb, but a most temperate, moist, natural heat, which proceeds from the very\u000alife of the mother.\u201d\u000aThis is good symbolism. The mother, as we have already discovered, is that Sephirah on the Tree\u000aof Life named Binah, and whilst she has various cosmic attributions she is also by reflection an interior\u000aor psychological principle. She it is who works in our interior natures as love, as intuition as aspiration,\u000aand all those higher and finer emotions which we seek to express just a little more easily in our own\u000adaily lives. From the psychological point of view she would represent the Unconscious, or more\u000aespecially what the analytical psychologists call the Anima, that vast sphere of feeling, emotion,\u000ainstinct, and intuition which lies beneath or beyond our normal awareness.\u000aWhat is it that proceeds from the very life of the Mother? Again, from the psychological viewpoint,\u000awe know that the Unconscious is the receptacle of the libido. We need not interpret libido in the crude\u000asexual way that Freud does, but rather we can speak of it as does Jung. Beatrice Hinkle, who translated\u000aJJung\u2019s Psychology of the Unconscious, gives us in a few words what Jung meant by this libido.\u000aHe saw (she says) in the term libido a concept of unknown nature comparable to Bergson\u2019s\u000aélan vital, a hypothetical energy of life, which occupies itself not only in sexuality but in various\u000aphysiological and psychological manifestations such as growth, development, hunger, and all the\u000ahuman activities and interests.\u000aNow, in the Qabalah the active agent in opposition to the passive agent is Chokmah, Will and\u000aWisdom. When we apply these principles to the human being there is of course no spatial concept\u000ainvolved, for we must not be led astray by the formal glyph which shows Chokmah to exist opposite\u000aBinah on the Tree of Life. These principles are interior principles, operating within. So Chokmah is,\u000afrom one point of view, our libido. Therefore the fire of the alchemists is libido, the internal fire - the\u000aWill, the Superior Will which Blavatsky has elsewhere defined as the power of the Spirit in action. The\u000aheat arising from the very life of the mother is none other than the power of Chokmah arising and\u000awelling up from the Unconscious depths of the psyche. The awakening of the Will therefore to renewed\u000aactivity is the crucial experience of the Spagyric Art. In one of the Golden Dawn documents entitled\u000a\u201cMan, the Microcosm\u201d we are told that \u201cin the Adept death can only supervene when the Higher Will\u000aconsenteth thereto, and herein is implied the whole Mystery of the Elixir of Life\u201d.\u000aOur text says of the fire that \u201cit is in itself natural, but the preparation of it is artificial\u201d. This we\u000ahave already understood from our perusal of the former texts. And Vaughan goes on to remark that \u201cit\u000ais not part of the matter, neither is it taken out of it, but it is an external fire and serves only to stir up\u000aand strengthen the inward oppressed fire of the Chaos\u201d. Here we are back once more on familiar\u000aground. In occultism there can be no initiation - that is \u201c the commencement of a new interior life - in a\u000acandidate or aspirant without an initiator. This process has been somewhat described in the magical\u000asection of Chapter Eight. In the mesmeric art it is the magnetism projected upon the patient by the\u000amagnetizer which enables the former to pass regressively, as Mrs. Atwood suggests, through the many\u000aphases of his historical and evolutionary development back to his long-forgotten life in Reality. Where\u000apsychological clinical work is concerned, it is the influence of the analyst which assists the analysand to\u000a\u000aPage 81\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000athrow off, through understanding, his infantile and other ignorant modes of reaction towards life, thus\u000acoming to know and of course to express what he really is. All these systems,, therefore, while\u000aexpressing the necessity of an inward development, point to the necessity of some extraneous force or\u000apersonality, which answers to the external fire, to awaken the individual into enlightenment.\u000aI do not wish to comment at too great length upon this Coelum Terrae of our Welsh Alchemist. I\u000afeel that enough has already been said in commentary upon the other two very important books to\u000aenable the individual to see herein very great significance. I have dwelt at great length on earlier pages\u000awith three different approaches, three different possible interpretations of the alchemical mystery. All\u000ayield a vast store of illuminating material to assist us in our comprehension of what the Alchemists\u000ameant. In this present text I believe we have a synthesis of all these three possible approaches. Here and\u000athere one finds statements which can only be interpreted along certain lines. By combining them,\u000ahowever, the entire text and the entire subject, which would otherwise be utter obscurity, emerge into\u000athe broad daylight of comprehension and understanding.\u000aIt is not difficult to realize what Vaughan\u2019s feeling is about alchemy. Nor will we experience any\u000aperplexity in understanding on what particular plane he himself interprets it. All we are asked to do is to\u000aapply ourselves just a little in meditation and reflection upon his statements. Do this in the light of the\u000amaterial we have uncovered above, and Alchemy at once reveals itself to us and discloses the golden\u000atreasure which it has concealed. Not only so - and this is most important - but at once something in us\u000abegins to stir, to awaken slowly into a new life. It seems as though the mere attempt, if it be\u000aaccompanied by sincerity and devotion, to fathom and unravel these mysteries brings about in our own\u000ainner souls something of that divine transmutation which it is the object of Alchemy to accomplish. And\u000awhile from all we have said it seems that the alchemists required the stimulus of an external fire in order\u000ato arouse the internal, I am quite convinced that the individual who attempts to divine the significance\u000aand subtle implications of Alchemy is doing two things.\u000aNot only will he acquire some intellectual knowledge of what Alchemy is, but he will at once\u000aawaken, partially at any rate, his own internal fire. This will, to use mystical phraseology, eventually\u000akindle the Light within him.\u000aThere are those in the universe, so the great archaic traditions of Mysticism run, whose task is to\u000awatch over mankind and to assist in the initiation of the race. They, we are told, never refuse the\u000atraining of those made ready by life and by experience. How do they become aware of suitable\u000aindividuals whose training they may further? These guardians or custodians of the secret knowledge\u000afind and select their students because with their spiritual vision they perceive the light emanating from\u000athat particular individual. It is a commonplace in occultism that surrounding each individual is a\u000amagnetic light-sphere, which glows with different colours corresponding to the status of that individual.\u000aLikewise it is susceptible to changes induced by will, thought, and feeling. So far as the student is\u000aconcerned, he himself inexorably draws to his sphere the initiator, who will be to him as the external\u000afire which will fan the dormant inner spiritual fire into a flame - a flame that is both creative and\u000adestructive. It is destructive to the coarse grosser elements of his constitution, but stimulating to that\u000aspiritual sperm which has been dormant for the countless ages of time.\u000aIt has been written in a book which nowadays possibly we are prone to ignore, The Light on the\u000aPath, that \u201cwhen the disciple is ready the teacher appears\u201d. Let us not therefore be saddened or dejected\u000aby our lack of immediate knowledge of our own divine natures. Our task is not so much to worry\u000aourselves as to the final implication of the alchemical art. That is something we must take in our stride,\u000aleaving it until such time as we have further and greater knowledge.\u000aMeanwhile we have much work at hand. By reflection, by study, by deep meditation upon these\u000amysteries, we can make our light glow from within. By an ineluctable process of magnetic attraction we\u000awill be drawn to, and likewise draw to us, the presence of just those students or teachers who will\u000afurther our growth in the direction of self-knowledge and self-transmutation.\u000aThe Alchemists themselves have promised that divine aid is always forthcoming to those who in\u000aall sincerity and humility do even no more than study their writings. In one sense we can see why this\u000ashould be so. For, as power awakens power, and as light does expel the darkness, so by assimilating the\u000awritten word of their wisdom, their illumination, and their undoubted spiritual experience, we awaken\u000awithin ourselves spontaneously a reflection of what it was that blessed them.\u000aReally, the process is not too dissimilar to the ordinary process of initiation. For example, in the\u000aLodge or Temple where once the rites of initiatory magic were celebrated, initiation was accomplished\u000aby hardly more than the candidate being bathed in the presence of, or the magnetism emanating from,\u000aan advanced initiator who was illuminated and knew how to stir up the spirit within him. On an earlier\u000apage I have described how, in the elemental initiations of that magical organization called The Hermetic\u000aOrder of the Golden Dawn, the evocation of the powers of the elements whatever they actually may be -\u000a\u000aPage 82\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000ahad the effect of arousing the elemental bases of the candidate, of exciting the various levels of his\u000aUnconscious psyche. Mere contact suffices.\u000aA similar process on another plane is narrated by Madame Blavatsky in The Secret Doctrine.\u000aThere she describes how men lacked mind in the early days of primitive evolution. The thinking\u000aprinciple had not yet been developed. It is her theory, and she quotes from innumerable sources to\u000afurther her contention., that it was by the contact of nascent humanity with beings of a superior mental\u000aevolution that Mind was reflected into the brain of man. How that came about we do not know, and I\u000ahardly need to labour the point. I am simply concerned at this moment in pointing out that in the contact\u000aof one mind with another, of one class of function with a superior function, the one may be assisted and\u000aelevated into a similar superior function. In this instance the initiator at the beginning of the path\u000aupwards to the Light can well be hardly more than a text. In such a text we have the living dynamic\u000athought of great adepts, great initiators. What they have recorded as being an experimental path to\u000asurmounting Nature, as a way to the discovery of ourselves, to the transmutation of the gross lead of\u000ahumanity into the pure gold of spiritual realization and divine action, can be for us exactly as if we had\u000aentered into direct communion with their own natures.\u000aI have a theory, and it is only a theory, that the adepts of all time - the saints, the Boddhisattvas,\u000acall them by what name you will - in having achieved the spiritual heights that they did achieve, left an\u000aindelible impress on the Anima Mundi, the Soul of the World, what Jung has called the Collective\u000aUnconscious. At great length this master psychologist has spoken of primordial archetypes or archaic\u000aimages that exist in the Unconscious of the Collective psyche. I believe that, because of what they have\u000adone, these great beings become identified with these archetypes, or themselves become other\u000aprimordial images. Their spiritual liberation identifies them with the celestial substratum shared by all\u000amen alike. The energy involved in such an attainment sets into motion powerful currents of impulse and\u000aideation which work their way, gradually and slowly, through the unconscious levels of the mass into\u000athe consciousness of the individual. Thus changes occur to an individual here and an individual there\u000awithout his actually being aware of the process involved in the incubation of ideas. These archetypes\u000aare the final cause of the instigation of movements based upon apparent personal inspiration. For Jung\u000asays, in confirmation, that the Unconscious contains not memories of infancy alone, but ideas as root\u000aand stem and seed which may not develop into conscious thought and action for very many years.\u000aHow do these root concepts arise in the collective Unconscious sphere? I believe, because of the\u000aexistence and attainment of individuals whose spiritual attainment has a dynamic effect upon the\u000acollective sphere.\u000aSince every individual is not only a conscious ego, but also possesses a personal Unconscious, and\u000asince, moreover, that personal Unconscious is always in direct contact with, or is a part of, the\u000aCollective Unconscious, we as ordinary individuals have direct access at all times to those primordial\u000aarchetypes, to those great beings. In a word, they exist in ourselves, as mainsprings of our psychic and\u000aspiritual life, of which we are not even aware. We have much for which to be grateful to modem\u000apsychology. For in confirmation of .ancient occultism it has demonstrated to the world that there may\u000aexist psychological principles of which we may be totally unconscious.\u000aIn these secret psychological or spiritual depths there exist, so I contend, the archetypes of all the\u000asaints that ever lived, the divine images of their attainment. Hermes, Basil Valentine, Sendivogius,\u000aSynesius, Khunrath, Eudoxus, and all the other beings we consider great not only in alchemy but also in\u000aMysticism and Religion - these beings have left indelible traces in the deeper parts of our own souls.\u000aLogically, it would follow, then, that by conscious reflection and inspired meditation upon the\u000awritings of these beings we have at least one technical method of evocation of the divine in us. Their\u000awords, should they take root, will awaken within us the archetype or primordial image which answers\u000aby sympathy to the writer thereof.\u000aSince these beings were illuminated, and abundantly blessed and divinely gifted, it is evident that\u000awe too are already, here and now, likewise illuminated. We also are similarly divinely blessed and\u000adivinely guided, if only we would realize it. We can realize it. They realized it. They were but men even\u000aas we are now. They achieved and accomplished the supreme transmutation. We also can achieve. That\u000atransmutation already exists in us now- at this very moment both of space and time. We are not asked to\u000ado the impossible. All we must do is somehow to realize it. Then the transmutation is made manifest\u000aand clear. As we come to understand that Jesus and Buddha, Hermes, and all the other adepts and saints\u000aof all time already exist deep within us, then by reflection upon their lives and their words we make\u000amanifest what hitherto had been concealed. We evoke them from within, and become consequently that\u000awhich we have invoked. The transmutation is effected for all to see. The Philosopher\u2019s Stone of divine\u000aunderstanding and knowledge will then have been concocted.\u000a\u000aPage 83\u000a\u000aIsrael Regardie - The Philosophers Stone\u000a\u000aPage 84\u000a\u000a
